# Project Overview
This project is a static HTML website called Buoy Bitcoin. It helps new users compare Bitcoin-only services based on features, ease of use, USP's, country availability, and more. It should be user friendly and easily navigatible. The goal is to reach 10.000 monthly visitors. 

# Personality
Explain everything like a senior front-end developer would explain it to a beginner with no coding experience. Be patient and clear.

# Tech Stack
- Static HTML
- CSS (vanilla, no framework)
- JavaScript (lightweight, if needed)
- We will add backend 


## Core Instructions
- For every code change, refactor, or generation:
  1. Provide a step-by-step explanation of what was changed.
  2. Describe why the change was made, including any trade-offs.
  3. Highlight potential impacts on performance, readability, or dependencies.
  4. Avoid unnecessary complexity. The fewer lines of code, the better.
- Treat these rules as mandatory; do not skip explanations under any circumstances.

# Processes

## GitHub Push Process
1. Make sure I'm on the correct branch (`main`)
2. Stage changes: `git add .`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Describe changes"`
4. Push: `git push`

Cursor, please follow this process when I ask you to push code to GitHub.


## Error Fixing
1. Explain the error in simple terms.
2. Suggest likely causes.
3. Show minimal, clean fix.

# Environment Variables
(none for now)

# File Structure

# Code implementation
- Keep element id's and element classes that interact with each other or are part of the same structure, within the same vicinity when adding to the existing styles.css file. For example: .menu.active should be near .hamburger because .menu.active is part of the .hamburger container. 
- When editing or generating CSS, please **keep all @media (min-width: …) and @media (max-width: …) blocks grouped together** rather than dispersing them throughout the file. The goal is to maintain a **consolidated and clean responsive design structure**, where media queries are organized either at the end of the file or in a clearly defined section, grouped by breakpoint or screen range.

This helps with maintainability and clarity in the stylesheet.
