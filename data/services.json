      {
        "q": "How does AnchorWatch's Trident vault insurance work?",
        "a": "AnchorWatch locks each deposit inside a Trident 2-of-3 multisig vault that maps to a Lloyd's-backed policy, so coverage follows the exact UTXO you fund. If you permanently lose control under the policy terms, you can file a claim instead of eating the loss."
      },
      {
        "q": "What does AnchorWatch charge for custody insurance?",
        "a": "Premiums run roughly 0.55%–2% of the insured value per year and are paid up front in USD. A Trident Services Fee of up to 0.25% annually (first $250k waived) is billed monthly so you can size coverage to your treasury."
      },
      {
        "q": "How fast can I move bitcoin out of an AnchorWatch vault?",
        "a": "You prepare and sign the spend in Trident, submit your evidence package, and AnchorWatch usually clears compliance plus its signature within one to two business days. Plan larger withdrawals ahead so insurance controls never become a surprise bottleneck."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does AnchorWatch require KYC and where is it available?",
        "a": "Yes. AnchorWatch underwrites regulated US policies, so onboarding requires identity documents or KYB packages and they currently insure only US-based clients."
      },
      {
        "q": "How are customer keys and funds segregated at AnchorWatch?",
        "a": "You generate your own keys on factory-sealed devices, and each vault has a unique output descriptor that proves funds are never commingled with other policyholders. You can verify segregation on-chain before depositing sats."

    "description": "AnchorWatch is a U.S.-based bitcoin custody and insurance provider trying to bridge traditional insurance with Bitcoin-native custody, delivering peace of mind by offering an elegant, turnkey solution for long-term bitcoin holders and corporate treasuries seeking secure, insured, and inheritance-ready custody.\n\nWhat separates AnchorWatch is their unique integration of protocol-level multisig vaults with time-locked recovery and insurance. Users hold a multi-signature key set alongside AnchorWatch; both are required to sign transactions, and over time additional recovery mechanisms activate to handle key-loss, death, or coercion scenarios.\n\nUser reviews and discussions (e.g. from the Build With Bitcoin transcript) emphasize AnchorWatch's layered approach: the combination of vault tech and insurance addresses both technical and human vulnerabilities. The service also supports inheritance planning—time-locked access for heirs without cumbersome \"treasure maps\". This focus on estate continuity is cited as a major differentiator, especially for non-technical beneficiaries.\n\nTheir future vision includes expanding beyond U.S. customers, offering bespoke large-value enterprise policies, and exploring Bitcoin-denominated insurance.",

    "description": "Bisq is a decentralized, open‑source desktop app created by Manfred Karrer for buying and selling bitcoin directly with other people. It routes all traffic over Tor, uses a built‑in non‑custodial wallet and has no sign‑ups or KYC. Trades span many national currencies and payment rails, and the project is funded and governed through a community DAO with the BSQ token rather than a company.\n\nWhat separates Bisq is its security and incentive design for fiat‑to‑BTC P2P. Each trade locks both sides’ refundable security deposits in a 2‑of‑2 multisig escrow. Account‑age and signing rules gradually raise per‑trade limits to reduce chargeback risk, and a small amount of bitcoin is required up front to cover fees and deposits. Trading fees are transparent and lower if paid in BSQ. It’s desktop‑first by design; the mobile app is for notifications.\n\nUser feedback highlights Bisq’s strengths in privacy, censorship resistance and self‑custody, along with clear, step‑by‑step trade flows and a multi‑stage dispute process if things go wrong.\n\nThe trade‑offs are thinner liquidity depending on region, wider spreads than convenience brokers, the need to already have a little bitcoin, and settlement times tied to the chosen fiat method and counterparties’ availability. Some users note that disputes can take time, and that desktop performance varies by setup.\n\nBisq’s target audience is privacy‑minded bitcoiners and anyone who needs a resilient, non‑custodial fiat ramp. The roadmap is to keep the marketplace permissionless while improving UX and resilience: Bisq 2 introduces a simpler “Bisq Easy” path alongside the familiar multisig protocol, support for multiple privacy networks, and optional use of Liquid for faster, lower‑fee settlement.",

    "description": "Bitkey is a mobile and hardware wallet developed by Block and designed for people new to Bitcoin who want simple, secure self-custody. The system combines a phone app with a wireless hardware device and an encrypted cloud backup, using a 2-of-3 multisig model to keep users in control of their funds. This structure allows users to recover access even if they lose their phone or the device, adding safety without relying on seed phrases.\\n\\nThe hardware, a sleek hexagonal device with a fingerprint sensor and NFC for phone pairing, eliminates the need for complex seed phrases, making it user-friendly. Sending Bitcoin requires both your phone and the Bitkey device, while smaller transactions can be approved using just your phone and Bitkey's server key if you've set spending limits. This balance appeals to people who want more security than just a phone wallet but don't want the complexity of most hardware wallets.\\n\\nUsers can set daily spending limits for app-only transactions, adding flexibility. The setup is quick, often taking just 5 minutes, and the app's clean interface is intuitive. The app allows Bitcoin purchases, shows balance in both sats and fiat, and offers recovery through trusted contacts in case of loss. It also lacks a screen, meaning you can't visually verify addresses on the hardware itself.\\n\\nBitkey's mission is to bring secure Bitcoin ownership to a global audience, especially those new to Bitcoin, by removing friction and avoiding the pitfalls of traditional backups. Their future vision includes broader international support, expanded wallet functionality, and continued emphasis on open-source development and user control. For beginners, Bitkey offers a straightforward, secure way to own Bitcoin with a polished user experience, though advanced users may want more flexibility.",

    "description": "Bitonic is the oldest and largest Bitcoin-only broker in the Netherlands, founded in 2012, with a reputation for reliability and simplicity. They offer fast, automatic Bitcoin delivery via iDEAL, SEPA, and Bancontact, and their fully automated system ensures quick transfers.\\n\\nIt stands out with its direct purchase model, selling Bitcoin from its own stock for instant delivery and transparent pricing, avoiding third-party intermediaries. Bitonic offers buying, selling, and saving Bitcoin via iDEAL, SEPA, or Bancontact and provide an Auto Invest savings feature, allowing users to easily set up recurring Bitcoin purchases, (though only up to €250 | 271,023 sats) and a business solution for Bitcoin payments.\\n\\nIts app, rated 4.5 stars on iOS, is praised for its clean, no-nonsense design, though some users report slow verification. The platform uses multi-signature cold storage for security and encourages self-custody with personal wallets.\\n\\nTheir vision focuses on making Bitcoin accessible and easy for Dutch and European users, backed by education through Bitonic Academy and news via Bitcoin.nl. Overall, Bitonic is ideal for beginners who want a reliable, no-altcoin platform in Europe, with fast transactions, clear pricing and a strong local support.",

Instant channel setups and automatic swaps keep the experience seamless while Breez encrypts your channel data to your cloud account after every payment.\n\nCompared with Phoenix's recovery phrase backups or Muun's dual on-chain approach, Breez focuses on automation: it handles all the technical channel work for you, but requires encrypted cloud backups and charges a 0.4% setup fee when new receiving capacity is needed.",

    "description": "Bull Bitcoin is a Canadian Bitcoin exchange that stands out by being entirely non-custodial, meaning users must provide their own wallet and take full ownership of their Bitcoin. It allows users to buy Bitcoin directly to their own wallets, sell Bitcoin instantly without waiting for confirmations, and even pay bills, rent, and credit cards in Canada by converting Bitcoin to fiat without relying on traditional banks. This approach positions Bitcoin as a tool for everyday exchange, not just long-term saving.\\n\\nThe platform (the mobile app is in beta) is self-funded, Bitcoin-only, and deeply ideological, rejecting external investors. Its team identifies as cypherpunks, building open-source tools and promoting financial sovereignty. Bull Bitcoin's mission is to create sovereign individuals through uncompromising adherence to Bitcoin principles, making it attractive to users who want to align their actions with their values.\\n\\nBeginners find the platform easy to use, with a clean interface and responsive support, while advanced users appreciate its strong privacy stance and no-compromise philosophy. It's ideal for Canadians and expanding internationally for those who want full control over their Bitcoin without depending on custodians or legacy finance systems.",

    "description": "Fold aims to make Bitcoin accessible by integrating it into daily financial activities. It offers a Visa prepaid debit card, gift card purchases, and bill payments, all rewarding users with Bitcoin (sats). Users can also buy Bitcoin with low or no fees, depending on their plan, and deposit Bitcoin into their Fold account for insured custody.\n\nWhat sets Fold apart is how it combines traditional finance functions like bill pay and debit card usage with Bitcoin rewards in one simple interface. Users don't need to juggle multiple apps or wallets. Rewards can be earned on nearly every transaction, from daily spending to mortgage payments, with bonus sats for gift card purchases. Fold also allows external Bitcoin deposits and provides low-fee conversions from paycheck to BTC, making it easy to live on a Bitcoin standard while minimizing taxable events.\n\nUsers praise the ease of use, the ability to stack Bitcoin passively, and the clear design of the app. Some power users run most of their household finances through Fold, using the gift card section for groceries and shopping, and setting up recurring buys with leftover balances at the end of each month. The ability to earn rewards even on ACH bill pay is seen as a unique benefit.\n\nFold's vision is to be the ultimate platform for living on a Bitcoin standard, making it easy to earn, spend, and save Bitcoin while navigating a fiat world, giving users control and flexibility without the complexity of traditional exchanges or wallets.",

    "description": "Hodl Hodl is a peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace that removes the custodial step most exchanges require. When you buy or sell on a typical platform, the exchange holds your funds and decides when you can withdraw. That reintroduces the same counterparty risk Bitcoin was designed to eliminate. Hodl Hodl takes a different approach: each trade locks bitcoin in a 2-of-3 multisig escrow that you, the counterparty, and Hodl Hodl support control together. Neither side can move the funds alone, which means trades settle directly between wallets without Hodl Hodl ever holding custody. That shifts trust from a centralized company to verifiable on-chain contracts.\n\nYou can sign up with an email and start trading without submitting identity documents. Hodl Hodl supports over 100 fiat currencies and lets sellers post offers using bank transfers, cash in person, Revolut, PayPal, and other payment rails you already trust. Premiums vary by offer and tend to be higher for new accounts until you complete a few trades and build reputation. The platform uses a limit tier system: as your reputation score grows through successful contracts and reviews, you unlock higher daily and lifetime trading caps.\n\nThe web interface is straightforward. You filter offers by country, currency, and payment method, read the seller's instructions, and open a contract. Both parties chat inside the contract, upload payment proof, and coordinate the release once fiat clears. If something breaks, you can open a dispute and Hodl Hodl support co-signs the multisig based on the evidence. A Testnet environment lets you rehearse the full workflow with valueless coins before risking real sats, so you learn the escrow flow, chat prompts, and dispute process without capital at stake.\n\nHodl Hodl fits users who want non-custodial trading and are comfortable managing their own wallets, confirming payments, and negotiating premiums. You bring your own Bitcoin wallet to every trade, which means no withdrawal limits or custodial freezes. The trade-off is that you handle more of the process yourself compared to a custodial exchange that automates order matching and holds funds. Choose Hodl Hodl when self-custody and privacy matter more than instant card funding or automated recurring buys.",

        "q": "How do Lightspark Connect fees work across Starter and Enterprise tiers?",
        "a": "Connect Starter routes every Lightning payment through Lightspark's managed nodes for 0.50% up to $300,000 in monthly volume. Enterprise plans add a $9,000-$15,000 platform retainer so you can drop per-transaction costs to roughly 0.30%-0.15% across $3-$15 million in monthly flow. You can start on Starter's free first 30 days and upgrade inside the dashboard once usage grows."
      },
      {
        "q": "When does Lightspark bill me for platform and overage fees?",
        "a": "Billing kicks in after the 30-day trial, when Lightspark invoices the platform fee for your tier at the beginning of each month. That same invoice lists any usage that exceeded your volume limits in the prior period so finance teams see one predictable charge. You can downgrade or pause before the next cycle if your run rate changes."
      },
      {
        "q": "How can I pay my Lightspark invoice?",
        "a": "Lightspark charges the card you keep on file five days after issuing the invoice, which removes manual payment work. Each invoice also includes a Lightning or on-chain Bitcoin link that locks the fiat amount in sats for 24 hours so you can settle with bitcoin instead. You can regenerate the payment quote from the invoice link whenever the price window expires."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I make payments from Lightspark?",
        "a": "Lightning payouts run through the Send flow or API/SDK while on-chain settlements use the Withdraw flow, so you choose the rail per transfer. That separation keeps instant Lightning transfers distinct from Bitcoin Layer 1 withdrawals that wait on block confirmations. You can set custom fee limits in the Send flow when you need to allow higher routing budgets."
      },
      {
        "q": "What protects my funds if Lightspark goes offline?",
        "a": "Passwords are recoverable through the Forgot your password link, but custody resilience comes from Lightspark's Funds Recovery Kit that generates pre-signed transactions. Once you configure the kit you can publish those transactions on Bitcoin Layer 1 to reclaim funds without waiting on Lightspark support. Treat the hosted stack as a bridge and store the recovery file offline so you always have an exit."

    "description": "Lightspark is a payments infrastructure company founded by David Marcus (formerly of PayPal, Meta, and Diem) in 2022. They aim to build what they call the \"Money Grid,\" a global, open payment network using Bitcoin as a neutral settlement layer and leveraging Lightning for high-speed transfers.\n\nTheir target audience includes enterprises—digital banks, fintechs, wallets, exchanges—that need to move money across currencies and jurisdictions instantly and cheaply, as well as developers building Bitcoin-native payment applications or self-custodial wallets that need scalable infrastructure.\n\nWhat sets Lightspark apart is their end-to-end product integration, combining seamless liquidity management, intelligent routing, compliance-ready infrastructure, and human-friendly Universal Money Address (UMA) tech. This abstraction lets banks, wallets, exchanges, and businesses effortlessly send and receive fiat or crypto globally without having to manage Lightning channels, cross-border FX, or complex on-chain details. These tools have already seen traction with big regulated partners and typically involves KYC via the partner.\n\nLooking forward, Lightspark's vision is to scale the Money Grid globally—connecting all real-time payment systems and making Bitcoin native rails for everything from everyday consumer transfers to B2B fiat-fiat flows. Spark aims to resolve key Lightning limitations like self-custody economic scalability and lacks native token support. By building Spark open-source and fully backward compatible with Lightning, they hope to decentralize stablecoin issuance on Bitcoin and finally realize high-velocity, global Bitcoin-based payment settlement.",

    "description": "Muun is a non-custodial Bitcoin and Lightning wallet focused on giving users full control with minimal complexity. It separates itself from other wallets through its unique security and backup model: users recover access using an email, password, and encrypted recovery code—removing the need to manage a traditional 12-word seed phrase. This makes onboarding easier for beginners without compromising self-custody.\\n\\nMuun's key differentiator is how it handles both Lightning and on-chain Bitcoin in one seamless balance. Users don't have to manage channels or worry about liquidity—Muun automates that behind the scenes. You can send or receive Bitcoin however you want, and the wallet figures out whether to use Lightning or regular Bitcoin based on speed, cost, and availability. This hybrid approach appeals to users who want convenience but still own their funds.\\n\\nUsers praise Muun for its simple design, clear recovery process, and solid privacy. It's especially recommended for first-time users who want a secure but low-friction experience. However, some note that Muun doesn't support Lightning addresses and that Lightning transactions may route via on-chain swaps. This means unpredictable fees, especially when onchain activity rises.\\n\\nMuun's mission is to provide a simple, secure way to use Bitcoin daily without needing technical knowledge. It prioritizes non-custodial access, user control, and cross-platform consistency, helping new users enter Bitcoin while retaining ownership from day one.",

      {
        "q": "How does OpenNode's hosted checkout work?",
        "a": "When you create a charge, OpenNode returns a checkout URL that bundles the Lightning invoice and on-chain address so customers can choose their rail. That means you can simply redirect to checkout.opennode.com/{id} and append ln or hf query switches to shape the experience."

      {
        "q": "What fees does OpenNode charge for processing and withdrawals?",
        "a": "OpenNode charges around 1% for processing plus on-demand on-chain withdrawals, while scheduled weekly transfers stay free and Lightning withdrawals are free. You can choose instant payouts when speed matters or lean on scheduled moves if you want to avoid the extra fee."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does OpenNode handle underpaid invoices?",
        "a": "You can set an underpayment tolerance so slightly short on-chain payments move forward automatically, and anything below the threshold is flagged as underpaid. Buyers can send the remaining sats or request a refund that returns their funds minus the 200 sat network fee, so you stay in control of the customer experience."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can OpenNode pay Lightning invoices from my fiat balance?",
        "a": "Yes. Wire fiat into your OpenNode local currency wallet and initiate Lightning or on-chain payouts directly from that balance. The platform quotes the BTC amount and handles conversion so you can fund global payouts without ever holding bitcoin on your books."
      },
      {
        "q": "What verification does OpenNode require?",
        "a": "Individual accounts submit government ID plus a fresh selfie, while businesses provide formation docs, ownership records, and proof of address so OpenNode can meet KYB obligations. That onboarding is what unlocks higher limits, fiat rails, and access to payout APIs."

    "description": "OpenNode is a Bitcoin-first payment processor that empowers businesses to accept and send Bitcoin—either on-chain or via Lightning—using simple plugins, hosted checkouts, or its developer-friendly API. Organisations that want a turnkey, compliant solution—especially mid-sized to large enterprises—can onboard easily with KYC and achieve global scale without building complex node infrastructure.\\n\\nIt offers instant, low-cost microtransactions with a focus on liquidity management, channel operations, and protocol support. For merchants, this means accessing Bitcoin payments both instantly and economically, alongside automatic settlement options in fiat or BTC. By abstracting away technical complexities like node handling, liquidity, and channel balance, OpenNode allows businesses to plug-and-play and scale efficiently.\\n\\nIt holds US regulatory licenses, manages KYC requirements, and maintains automated fiat conversions and payouts. This makes it ideal for businesses—especially blue-chip and enterprise-level—that require solid legal and financial backstops.\\n\\nTheir long-term vision is to see global businesses and platforms integrate Bitcoin payments as seamlessly as credit cards—secure, censorship-resistant, and frictionless—while pushing forward broader adoption of Bitcoin as a unit of exchange across borders and cultures.",

      {
        "q": "How does Peach multisig escrow protect peer-to-peer trades?",
        "a": "Each Peach trade starts with the seller locking sats in a 2-of-2 address that needs both the seller and Peach to co-sign the release. That prevents either party from moving the funds alone and lets Peach finish the release after roughly 4,320 blocks if a dispute stalls. You can copy the escrow address from the trade details and verify it on a block explorer before you send fiat."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does Peach require KYC verification for every trade?",
        "a": "Peach operates under Swiss rules that allow KYC-free swaps up to about 1,000 CHF per person each day. That keeps small trades private while still meeting compliance. You can split larger purchases across days if you want to stay under the no-KYC threshold."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I back up my Peach account file safely?",
        "a": "Peach keeps your wallet, contacts, and payment templates in an encrypted account file that lives on your phone. If you lose that file or forget the password, Peach cannot restore the wallet for you. You can export the backup from Settings > Backup and store it offline on an SD card, computer, or encrypted cloud folder."
      },
      {
        "q": "Which payment methods can I use on Peach?",
        "a": "Offers cover more than 100 rails ranging from SEPA, bank transfers, and Wise to gift cards and cash in person depending on your counterparty. That flexibility lets you meet peers where you already have accounts. You can filter offers by payment type so you only see options you trust."
      },
      {
        "q": "What happens if my counterparty disappears during a trade?",
        "a": "If the other party stops responding, you can open a dispute inside the trade chat so Peach mediators review the evidence. They can co-sign the escrow to release bitcoin to the buyer or seller once payment proof is clear, preventing funds from getting stuck. You can keep screenshots, receipts, and chat logs ready so disputes resolve quickly."

    "description": "Phoenix is designed to provide a simple, self-custodial experience for fast, low-cost Lightning transactions directly on mobile devices, emphasizing ease of use for beginners.\\n\\nPhoenix runs a native Lightning node on the user's device, connecting to ACINQ's node for automated channel management, eliminating the need for swaps and reducing fees for direct Lightning payments. Additionally, Phoenix allows connections to a user's own Bitcoin node for enhanced privacy.\\n\\nFor beginners, Phoenix's intuitive UI, low-cost Lightning transactions, and self-custodial design make it ideal for those starting with Bitcoin, though channel size limitations may require occasional fee adjustments for frequent receivers. Compared to Breez's merchant-centric features or Aqua's Liquid-focused versatility, Phoenix excels in delivering a straightforward, cost-effective Lightning experience with robust privacy options.",

    "description": "Relai, founded in 2020 in Zürich, Switzerland, is an app designed for beginners to buy and save Bitcoin easily. It stands out from competitors with its non-custodial wallet, meaning users control their Bitcoin via a 12-word seed phrase. After purchasing Bitcoin, it will be directly sent to your wallet.\\n\\nRelai offers purchases starting at €50 | 54,205 sats, one free buy up to €100 | 108,409 sats monthly, until you hit €1200. After that you pay a 1% fee for any transaction. For businesses and wealthy individuals Relai offers personal service and expert guidance.\\n\\nIts app, rated 4.5 stars on iOS, is praised by users for simple onboarding and smooth navigation, though some users report verification delays or high card fees. Relai focuses on privacy and self-custody, with optional KYC for small transactions.\\n\\nIts vision is to make Bitcoin saving accessible across Europe, with plans to add Lightning Network support for faster payments. Beginners love its straightforward design and security, but it's limited to Europe and lacks advanced savings features.",

        "q": "How do River's fees compare to staying on an exchange?",
        "a": "River's trading fee starts at 1% and drops to 0.25% as your volume grows. Recurring buys skip fees entirely after the first week, and you can pair that with Auto-withdraw to move sats to self-custody automatically—though keeping some balance on River for active trading can make sense depending on your workflow."
      },
      {
        "q": "When can I withdraw ACH-funded bitcoin to my own wallet?",
        "a": "ACH deposits trade instantly but stay pending about seven days until settlement clears. Once funds move to available balance you can withdraw to self-custody. River holds the keys during that time, which introduces the usual custodial and counterparty considerations."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's the exit path for moving sats off River?",
        "a": "Lightning withdrawals are free and instant once your balance is available. On-chain offers Priority, Standard, and Flexible tiers depending on how quickly you need confirmation. Auto-withdraw can move sats automatically when you hit a threshold, though manual withdrawals give you more control over timing and fee selection."
      },
      {
        "q": "What's the trade-off with Bitcoin Interest on Cash?",
        "a": "River pays 3.5% APY on idle cash and converts interest to bitcoin monthly. Your cash stays custodial during this time, which means trusting River's reserves without per-user on-chain proof. Some people use this for working capital while moving long-term holdings to self-custody; others prefer to avoid custodial yield entirely."
      },
      {
        "q": "Where is River available and what are the limits?",
        "a": "River serves U.S. residents, though some states face additional verification steps until local licensing clears. The service is custodial, which means River holds the keys while you use the platform—you can withdraw to self-custody at any time once your deposits settle."

Unlike many platforms, River holds all Bitcoin in full-reserve cold storage with multi-signature security and gives users transparency through real-time proof of reserves. This might sound inviting to people who don't want to hold Bitcoin in self-custody but it also means more centralization within Bitcoin.\\n\\nIt supports things like inheritance planning, business accounts, and joint accounts, making it attractive for people who want to treat Bitcoin like serious money. Users can buy Bitcoin instantly, set up automated savings, and send Bitcoin via on-chain or Lightning payments. On top of that, you can earn 3.8% Bitcoin interest on your cash. The app has a clean interface and is designed to be easy to use, earning high ratings on both iOS and Android.\\n\\nRiver's mission is to provide a trusted, high-quality experience for people who want to build wealth in Bitcoin without distractions. It aims to give users full control and transparency. While some users note strict ID verification and limited availability outside the U.S., River is praised for its reliability, personal customer service, and focus on security.",

      {
        "q": "How do RoboSats Lightning bonds and escrow work?",
        "a": "Each contract starts with the maker posting a Lightning hold-invoice bond—defaults to ~3% of the trade—and the taker matching it when they join, while the seller locks the sats in a hold invoice escrow. That lock keeps funds frozen until both parties confirm fiat, which means you can complete the trade and reclaim everything or cancel during the timer if the peer stalls."

      {
        "q": "What fees does RoboSats charge on trades?",
        "a": "RoboSats collects 0.2% per completed trade, split 0.1% to the maker and 0.1% to the taker when the hold invoice settles. That sits on top of whatever spread you negotiate, so you can tighten your offers to keep the total cost in sats low."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does RoboSats require KYC or accounts?",
        "a": "Instead of accounts, RoboSats generates a one-time robot avatar from a secret token you control and stores only that token locally. That keeps your personal data off the coordinator, and you can rotate a fresh robot for every trade to keep orders unlinkable."
      },
      {
        "q": "Which Lightning wallets work best with RoboSats?",
        "a": "You need a Lightning wallet that can issue invoices and hold payments for a few minutes; RoboSats docs highlight Zeus, Blixt, Phoenix, Breez, Mutiny, and BlueWallet (LDK) because they keep the bond open until fiat clears. That support prevents premature expiry, and you can keep a second wallet with inbound liquidity ready if your main one is routing a large trade."
      },
      {
        "q": "How are disputes handled if a counterparty does not release sats?",
        "a": "If fiat fails, you hit Dispute in the chat, upload the payment proof, and the coordinator reviews both bond invoices plus your evidence. Their ruling routes the trade hold invoice either to you or the counterparty, so you can recover funds when you documented the fiat leg."

    "description": "RoboSats is a privacy‑first, Lightning‑native peer‑to‑peer exchange for buying and selling bitcoin with fiat. It is open‑source, requires no registration or KYC, and runs primarily over Tor (with I2P and an Android app available). Each trade uses a one‑time “robot” identity tied to a secret token you control, and all peer chat is end‑to‑end encrypted with PGP. The flow is simple: make or take an order, both sides lock small Lightning bonds, the seller locks a Lightning hold‑invoice escrow, fiat moves, then sats are released.\n\nWhat separates RoboSats is how deeply privacy and safety are built into the mechanics rather than bolted on. One‑trade identities reduce linkability across orders, PGP‑sealed chat prevents metadata leakage, and Lightning hold invoices act as both escrow and fidelity bonds to discourage cancellations and fraud. Pricing is transparent and market‑relative, fees are low at 0.2% split between maker and taker, and optional on‑chain payouts are handled via swaps. Clear best‑practice guides help users pick lower‑risk fiat rails and avoid chargeback traps.\n\nThe ideal audience is anyone who wants fast, low‑fee, no‑KYC bitcoin for modest amounts and is comfortable using Tor and a compatible Lightning wallet. Trade sizes are tuned to what routes reliably on Lightning today, which suits frequent smaller buys and sells. The UI is straightforward once you learn the token/robot model, and the documentation walks through wallet compatibility, order timing, disputes, and payment‑method hygiene to keep trades quick and clean.\n\nRoboSats’ vision is to keep P2P bitcoin simple, private, and resilient, with a path toward a federated network of coordinators sharing a unified order book to reduce single‑operator risk while preserving the familiar UX.",

      {
        "q": "How does Sparrow connect to my Bitcoin node?",
        "a": "Sparrow talks to Bitcoin Core or an Electrum server to fetch your balance and broadcast transactions. If you use a public server, you share your privacy with that operator. Connecting to your own node means you validate the chain yourself and leak no data to third parties. You can configure this in the Server settings tab immediately."
      },
      {
        "q": "Does Sparrow support hardware wallets?",
        "a": "Yes. Sparrow acts as the interface (watch-only wallet) for your hardware device. That means your private keys never touch the internet-connected computer, preventing malware from stealing your funds. You can connect almost any hardware wallet via USB or air-gapped via QR code/SD card to sign transactions securely."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I mix my coins with Sparrow?",
        "a": "Sparrow integrates Whirlpool to break the link between your past and future transactions. Most wallets leave a transparent trail on the blockchain that surveillance firms track. Mixing mathematically severs those links by combining your inputs with others. You can mix your funds directly within the app to regain your financial privacy."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is Sparrow a hot wallet or a cold wallet?",
        "a": "It can be either, depending on how you set it up. If you create a software wallet with keys on your computer, it is a hot wallet suitable for small amounts. If you connect a hardware device like a Coldcard, Sparrow becomes a cold storage interface. That flexibility lets you use the same software for daily spending and deep cold storage."
      },
      {
        "q": "Why is coin control important in Sparrow?",
        "a": "Coin control reveals the individual chunks of bitcoin (UTXOs) that make up your balance. Without it, wallets automatically merge coins, potentially linking private non-KYC funds with public KYC funds. Sparrow lets you label and select specific coins for every spend. That means you maintain the privacy boundaries you have built."

    "description": "Sparrow Wallet is a desktop Bitcoin wallet designed to give users full control over their bitcoin. It was created by developer Craig Raw and is open-source, privacy-focused, and ideal for both beginners and advanced users. The wallet works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nWhat separates Sparrow from other wallets is its balance between simplicity and advanced features. Beginners can start with a basic hot wallet setup and gradually explore more complex features like hardware wallet integration, multisig vaults, and UTXO control—all within the same interface. It gives users direct visibility into how Bitcoin works, showing transaction details, input and output flows, and allowing for precise control over fees and coin selection. This level of transparency helps users understand and manage their funds more deliberately.\n\nUser reviews highlight how Sparrow scales with you as you learn. It is refered to as the most powerful and versatile Bitcoin wallet, and users praise its clean layout, customizable setup, and educational value. Despite its many features, the app's interface is considered clear and organized once users get past the initial learning curve.\n\nSparrow's vision is to offer users complete sovereignty over their bitcoin. It avoids mobile compromises and instead focuses on a desktop experience that can integrate with cold storage, your own node, and advanced privacy tools. For beginners who want to grow into more advanced use cases without switching wallets, Sparrow offers a flexible and educational path to full control.",

Their mission is to eliminate reliance on centralized third parties, placing privacy, decentralization, and individual autonomy at the forefront. Unlike other DIY solutions, Start9 aims to \"level the playing field,\" offering plug-and-play hardware kits (like Server One and Server Pure) or a do-it-yourself image for Raspberry Pi or x86, all fully supported by their first-class community and expert support team.\\n\\nStart9's target users are privacy-conscious individuals, Bitcoiners, and anyone seeking digital autonomy without sacrificing usability. They prioritize delivering polished self-sovereign computing with high-quality hardware, intuitive interfaces, and expert support (via Matrix) to onboard less technical users while remaining fully transparent and open-source. Users appreciate its robust foundation, modular update system (allowing single-service patching), backup ease, and strong headless health checking—compared to alternatives like Umbrel.\\n\\nLooking forward, Start9 envisions a world where personal servers become the backbone of a sovereign internet and smart homes, enabling blockchain-native apps, decentralized messaging, password managers, file storage, and more. Their open hardware and software philosophy ensures that even if the company disappears, the ecosystem lives on—fully community-driven and censorship-resistant.",

        "q": "How do Strike's bitcoin trading fees work?",
        "a": "Strike charges a tiered Strike fee that starts at 0.99% for monthly volume under $250 and steps down to 0.39% once you trade more than $15,000,000. Recurring purchases skip the fee after the first cycle for hourly or daily schedules and after the second run for weekly or monthly schedules."

Once the deposit moves to available balance you can send, spend, or withdraw it."
      },
      {
        "q": "Are Lightning withdrawals free?",

      {
        "q": "How do bitcoin auto-withdrawals work?",
        "a": "You can set a threshold between 1,000,000 and 500,000,000 sats along with one or more payout addresses. When your available balance crosses the threshold Strike queues the full amount, gives you a 12 hour window to cancel, then broadcasts within 24 hours using the fee-free Flexible tier."

        "a": "Strike is available across the United States except New York, Puerto Rico, and in more than 95 other countries. Availability and payment methods vary, so confirm support in your local App Store or on the Strike website."

The mobile interface puts bank, card, and direct deposit funding beside instant Lightning withdrawals, so you can move from fiat to bitcoin and back with minimal steps.\n\nFunding options cover fee-free ACH, debit cards with a small processor fee, and same day wires. ACH deposits trade instantly yet stay pending for roughly five business days before you can withdraw, while wires settle in about one business day and debit card purchases clear immediately.\n\nRecurring purchases waive the Strike fee after the first cycle, and optional auto-withdrawals move your balance to self custody once it reaches the threshold you set. Customer prompts inside the app highlight fee tiers, settlement speed, and the 12 hour cancel window Strike gives you before broadcasting auto-withdrawals.",

It automatically withdraws BTC weekly to your own address and provides guides for self-custody, while also offering Swan Guard with fraud protection and identity verification tools. Swan prioritizes teaching users about Bitcoin's value for financial freedom. Swan also targets long-term savers by offering IRA products making Bitcoin tax-advantaged retirement savings easier.\n\nSwan offers zero-fee purchases on the first $10,000, a low 0.99% fee for recurring buys, and free withdrawals to personal wallets, encouraging self-custody. Its app is praised for its clean design and simple setup. However, some users report slow customer support and issues with account restrictions.\n\nIts vision is to onboard 10 million Bitcoin users by promoting Bitcoin as better money for a decentralized future.",

    "description": "Umbrel bundles Bitcoin Core, Lightning daemons, and a catalog of home-server apps into a single dashboard you host on your own hardware. Because your node verifies blocks locally, you no longer depend on third-party APIs for mempool data or wallet balances, and the App Store manages containers for tools like Electrs, Mempool, BTCPay, or even photo libraries without touching the command line.\n\nThat convenience comes with trade-offs. Umbrel keeps its UI on HTTP inside your LAN, uses a source-available license, and manages updates centrally, so you inherit their defaults unless you harden the stack with Tor-only access, VLAN isolation, and custom reverse proxies. You can export backups, disable telemetry, and lock down SSH, but long-term safety still depends on how you provision hardware, power, and backups.\n\nUse Umbrel when you want a polished, guided path into running your own Bitcoin stack alongside other self-hosted services. If you need reproducible builds, deterministic updates, or air-gapped security policies, treat Umbrel as a starter kit and graduate to a more open stack once you’re comfortable maintaining the moving pieces.",

    "description": "Unchained is a Bitcoin financial services company focused on helping individuals and businesses secure their Bitcoin through collaborative custody. Their main product is a multisig vault that uses a 2-of-3 key setup, where the user holds two keys and Unchained holds the third. This setup allows users to maintain full control over their Bitcoin while enabling Unchained to assist in recovery if needed, without ever having unilateral access to the funds.\n\nWhat makes Unchained unique is its emphasis on combining technical security with user support. Unlike standard hardware wallet setups that rely on a single point of failure, Unchained's model is resistant to user error and device loss. Even if you lose 75% of your devices or backups, you can still recover your funds with Unchained's help. Their system also facilitates inheritance by allowing next of kin to recover funds with proper documentation, making it especially appealing for those thinking about long-term wealth protection.\n\nUnchained users appreciate the guided onboarding, live support, and optional concierge services that simplify the complex process of setting up multisig. The platform integrates with popular hardware wallets, and allows users to manage their funds through Unchained's dashboard or export and interact with their vault using open-source tools. The ability to spend from your vault without relying on the Unchained website gives users additional peace of mind.\n\nThe company's long-term vision is to build a robust financial ecosystem based on Bitcoin-native tools, including multisig-secured lending, inheritance planning, and business services. While the setup requires ID verification and Unchained knows the vault balances, many users view this trade-off as acceptable in exchange for improved recovery options and strong operational security.\n\nUnchained is best suited for those seeking to remove single points of failure in their Bitcoin custody, want professional assistance when needed, and value redundancy and inheritance planning—all while retaining full self-custody.",

        "q": "Does Wasabi Wallet always run over Tor?",

        "q": "What fees should I expect when using Wasabi Wallet?",
        "a": "The software is free, every transaction still pays the standard mining fee, and CoinJoin rounds add roughly a 0.3% coordinator fee for inputs above 0.01 BTC while smaller inputs only pay miners. You can delay mixes or spend unmixed coins when privacy is less critical."

    "description": "Wasabi Wallet is a privacy-focused, open-source, non‑custodial Bitcoin desktop wallet launched by zkSNACKs. It routes all traffic through Tor and uses compact blockchain filters, keeping your IP and balance private. Its standout feature is built-in CoinJoin, a process that mixes your Bitcoin with others' to make it harder for anyone to trace your transactions, enhancing privacy without relying on third parties.\\n\\nThe user interface is straightforward but functional, with a dashboard showing your balance, privacy progress, and transaction history, though it may feel technical for complete beginners. Setup involves writing down a 12-word seed phrase and an optional passphrase, which adds security but requires careful storage.\\n\\nWhat sets Wasabi apart is its strong focus on privacy through CoinJoin, which is seamlessly integrated and doesn't require manual setup, making it accessible for newcomers. It also allows advanced users to connect to custom coordinators via platforms like Nostr, ensuring privacy even if default services are unavailable.\\n\\nWasabi is for people who want to own their Bitcoin without having to trust big companies. It hides your transactions by mixing them with others, runs silently in the background over Tor, and gives you full control—all on your own computer. Its goal is to make privacy easy and powerful, while building toward a future where you don't rely on any single server.",
