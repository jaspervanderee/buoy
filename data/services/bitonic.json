      "a": "Bitonic waives the service charge on the first €250 you auto-invest each calendar month, then charges 0.89% on additional volume plus a €0.15 SEPA processing fee and the prevailing network fee."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Bitonic send bitcoin directly to my wallet after each purchase?",

  "description": "Bitonic is the oldest and largest Bitcoin-only broker in the Netherlands, founded in 2012, with a reputation for reliability and simplicity. They offer fast, automatic Bitcoin delivery via iDEAL, SEPA, and Bancontact, and their fully automated system ensures quick transfers.\\n\\nIt stands out with its direct purchase model, selling Bitcoin from its own stock for instant delivery and transparent pricing, avoiding third-party intermediaries. Bitonic offers buying, selling, and saving Bitcoin via iDEAL, SEPA, or Bancontact and provide an Auto Invest savings feature, allowing users to easily set up recurring Bitcoin purchases, (though only up to €250 | 271,023 sats) and a business solution for Bitcoin payments.\\n\\nIts app, rated 4.5 stars on iOS, is praised for its clean, no-nonsense design, though some users report slow verification. The platform uses multi-signature cold storage for security and encourages self-custody with personal wallets.\\n\\nTheir vision focuses on making Bitcoin accessible and easy for Dutch and European users, backed by education through Bitonic Academy and news via Bitcoin.nl. Overall, Bitonic is ideal for beginners who want a reliable, no-altcoin platform in Europe, with fast transactions, clear pricing and a strong local support.",
