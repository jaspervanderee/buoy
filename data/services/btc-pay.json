    {
      "q": "How does BTCPay Server keep invoices self-hosted?",
      "a": "BTCPay runs on hardware you control, so invoices, stores, and payment history live on your own server rather than a processor's database."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the hosting options for BTCPay Server?",
      "a": "You can deploy on a $10–$70 per month VPS, use a one-click host like LunaNode or Voltage, or install it on dedicated hardware at home."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I pay any platform fees when customers pay invoices?",
      "a": "No platform fees apply - only the Bitcoin network fees you select for on-chain payouts or the liquidity costs of your Lightning channels."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I register and secure admin access?",
      "a": "The first account on a new instance becomes the admin, so create it yourself, enable 2FA, and configure SMTP so you can recover passwords later."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can BTCPay connect to my existing e-commerce stack?",
      "a": "Yes. Official plugins cover WooCommerce, Shopify via a bridge, Magento, Zapier, and dozens more, and you can run the point-of-sale or crowdfunding apps directly from BTCPay."
