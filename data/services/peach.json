  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How does Peach multisig escrow protect peer-to-peer trades?",
      "a": "Each Peach trade starts with the seller locking sats in a 2-of-2 address that needs both the seller and Peach to co-sign the release. That prevents either party from moving the funds alone and lets Peach finish the release after roughly 4,320 blocks if a dispute stalls. You can copy the escrow address from the trade details and verify it on a block explorer before you send fiat."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Peach require KYC verification for every trade?",
      "a": "Peach operates under Swiss rules that allow KYC-free swaps up to about 1,000 CHF per person each day. That keeps small trades private while still meeting compliance. You can split larger purchases across days if you want to stay under the no-KYC threshold."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I back up my Peach account file safely?",
      "a": "Peach keeps your wallet, contacts, and payment templates in an encrypted account file that lives on your phone. If you lose that file or forget the password, Peach cannot restore the wallet for you. You can export the backup from Settings > Backup and store it offline on an SD card, computer, or encrypted cloud folder."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which payment methods can I use on Peach?",
      "a": "Offers cover more than 100 rails ranging from SEPA, bank transfers, and Wise to gift cards and cash in person depending on your counterparty. That flexibility lets you meet peers where you already have accounts. You can filter offers by payment type so you only see options you trust."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens if my counterparty disappears during a trade?",
      "a": "If the other party stops responding, you can open a dispute inside the trade chat so Peach mediators review the evidence. They can co-sign the escrow to release bitcoin to the buyer or seller once payment proof is clear, preventing funds from getting stuck. You can keep screenshots, receipts, and chat logs ready so disputes resolve quickly."

        "q": "Can I reuse the same cold storage address?",
