  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How do River's fees compare to staying on an exchange?",
      "a": "River's trading fee starts at 1% and drops to 0.25% as your volume grows. Recurring buys skip fees entirely after the first week, and you can pair that with Auto-withdraw to move sats to self-custody automatically—though keeping some balance on River for active trading can make sense depending on your workflow."
    },
    {
      "q": "When can I withdraw ACH-funded bitcoin to my own wallet?",
      "a": "ACH deposits trade instantly but stay pending about seven days until settlement clears. Once funds move to available balance you can withdraw to self-custody. River holds the keys during that time, which introduces the usual custodial and counterparty considerations."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the exit path for moving sats off River?",
      "a": "Lightning withdrawals are free and instant once your balance is available. On-chain offers Priority, Standard, and Flexible tiers depending on how quickly you need confirmation. Auto-withdraw can move sats automatically when you hit a threshold, though manual withdrawals give you more control over timing and fee selection."
    },
    {
      "q": "What's the trade-off with Bitcoin Interest on Cash?",
      "a": "River pays 3.5% APY on idle cash and converts interest to bitcoin monthly. Your cash stays custodial during this time, which means trusting River's reserves without per-user on-chain proof. Some people use this for working capital while moving long-term holdings to self-custody; others prefer to avoid custodial yield entirely."
    },
    {
      "q": "Where is River available and what are the limits?",
      "a": "River serves U.S. residents, though some states face additional verification steps until local licensing clears. The service is custodial, which means River holds the keys while you use the platform—you can withdraw to self-custody at any time once your deposits settle."

  "description": "River helps U.S. based customers invest in Bitcoin simply and securely with a focus on long-term saving. Unlike many platforms, River holds all Bitcoin in full-reserve cold storage with multi-signature security and gives users transparency through real-time proof of reserves. This might sound inviting to people who don't want to hold Bitcoin in self-custody but it also means more centralization within Bitcoin.\\n\\nIt supports things like inheritance planning, business accounts, and joint accounts, making it attractive for people who want to treat Bitcoin like serious money. Users can buy Bitcoin instantly, set up automated savings, and send Bitcoin via on-chain or Lightning payments. On top of that, you can earn 3.8% Bitcoin interest on your cash. The app has a clean interface and is designed to be easy to use, earning high ratings on both iOS and Android.\\n\\nRiver's mission is to provide a trusted, high-quality experience for people who want to build wealth in Bitcoin without distractions. It aims to give users full control and transparency. While some users note strict ID verification and limited availability outside the U.S., River is praised for its reliability, personal customer service, and focus on security.",
