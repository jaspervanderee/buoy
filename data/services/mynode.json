    {
      "q": "How do MyNode hardware options compare between Model One and Model Two?",
      "a": "Model One bundles the single-board computer, SSD enclosure, and cabling so you plug it in and let it sync, while Model Two adds internal NVMe storage, a power button, and more CPU headroom for heavy apps. Pick the chassis that matches how much routing, indexing, or marketplace usage you expect to run."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is MyNode free or do I need a Premium license?",
      "a": "The Community Edition download is free and already runs the Bitcoin, Lightning, and Tor stack, and the $79 Premium key unlocks extra marketplace apps, VPN profiles, and direct support. You can start with the free build and upgrade later without reinstalling."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long does the initial MyNode sync take?",
      "a": "MyNode verifies every block from genesis on your hardware, so Raspberry Pi builds often need six or more days before Bitcoin Core reaches tip. Leave it wired and powered 24/7 or move to an x86 mini PC if you want that first sync to finish faster."
    },
    {
      "q": "What default credentials and product keys should I expect on first boot?",
      "a": "The dashboard lives at mynode.local with `admin` / `bolt` as the default login and immediately asks for your product key or the Community Edition option, so anyone on your LAN could log in until you change it. Swap the password, store the key safely, and only then expose Tor or VPN access."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I reach MyNode remotely once it is online?",
      "a": "MyNode generates Tor onion links and downloadable VPN profiles so you can reach Ride The Lightning or the main UI without opening clearnet ports. Import the OpenVPN file or use the Tor URL in your wallet when you need to manage channels away from home."

  "description": "MyNode is a turnkey Bitcoin and Lightning node platform that combines open‑source software with a polished, full‑featured web interface, making it accessible to both novices and advanced users.\\n\\nWhat sets MyNode apart is its integration of a wide array of Bitcoin tools all in one place—your own full node, Lightning (via LND), Electrum server, block explorers, wallet pairing tools and more—coordinated through an intuitive UI.\\n\\nThe target audience ranges from beginners who can get started with simple, plug‑and‑play hardware builds or prebuilt units, to seasoned users. The Premium+ hardware options (Model One/Two) bundle top‑spec hardware with built‑in support and warranty, while DIYers can start with the free software and chosen hardware.\\n\\nLooking ahead, MyNode continues to expand its ecosystem with new beta apps and features plus consistent rapid updates and community‑driven development. Their vision is clear: empower individuals to run a sovereign, private, and all‑in‑one Bitcoin infrastructure at home, easily and robustly, with ongoing innovation and support.",
