  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How does Sparrow connect to my Bitcoin node?",
      "a": "Sparrow talks to Bitcoin Core or an Electrum server to fetch your balance and broadcast transactions. If you use a public server, you share your privacy with that operator. Connecting to your own node means you validate the chain yourself and leak no data to third parties. You can configure this in the Server settings tab immediately."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Sparrow support hardware wallets?",
      "a": "Yes. Sparrow acts as the interface (watch-only wallet) for your hardware device. That means your private keys never touch the internet-connected computer, preventing malware from stealing your funds. You can connect almost any hardware wallet via USB or air-gapped via QR code/SD card to sign transactions securely."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I mix my coins with Sparrow?",
      "a": "Sparrow integrates Whirlpool to break the link between your past and future transactions. Most wallets leave a transparent trail on the blockchain that surveillance firms track. Mixing mathematically severs those links by combining your inputs with others. You can mix your funds directly within the app to regain your financial privacy."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is Sparrow a hot wallet or a cold wallet?",
      "a": "It can be either, depending on how you set it up. If you create a software wallet with keys on your computer, it is a hot wallet suitable for small amounts. If you connect a hardware device like a Coldcard, Sparrow becomes a cold storage interface. That flexibility lets you use the same software for daily spending and deep cold storage."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is coin control important in Sparrow?",
      "a": "Coin control reveals the individual chunks of bitcoin (UTXOs) that make up your balance. Without it, wallets automatically merge coins, potentially linking private non-KYC funds with public KYC funds. Sparrow lets you label and select specific coins for every spend. That means you maintain the privacy boundaries you have built."

  "description": "Sparrow Wallet is a desktop Bitcoin wallet designed to give users full control over their bitcoin. It was created by developer Craig Raw and is open-source, privacy-focused, and ideal for both beginners and advanced users. The wallet works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nWhat separates Sparrow from other wallets is its balance between simplicity and advanced features. Beginners can start with a basic hot wallet setup and gradually explore more complex features like hardware wallet integration, multisig vaults, and UTXO control—all within the same interface. It gives users direct visibility into how Bitcoin works, showing transaction details, input and output flows, and allowing for precise control over fees and coin selection. This level of transparency helps users understand and manage their funds more deliberately.\n\nUser reviews highlight how Sparrow scales with you as you learn. It is refered to as the most powerful and versatile Bitcoin wallet, and users praise its clean layout, customizable setup, and educational value. Despite its many features, the app's interface is considered clear and organized once users get past the initial learning curve.\n\nSparrow's vision is to offer users complete sovereignty over their bitcoin. It avoids mobile compromises and instead focuses on a desktop experience that can integrate with cold storage, your own node, and advanced privacy tools. For beginners who want to grow into more advanced use cases without switching wallets, Sparrow offers a flexible and educational path to full control.",
