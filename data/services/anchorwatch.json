    {
      "q": "How does AnchorWatch's Trident vault insurance work?",
      "a": "AnchorWatch locks each deposit inside a Trident 2-of-3 multisig vault that maps to a Lloyd's-backed policy, so coverage follows the exact UTXO you fund. If you permanently lose control under the policy terms, you can file a claim instead of eating the loss."
    },
    {
      "q": "What does AnchorWatch charge for custody insurance?",
      "a": "Premiums run roughly 0.55%–2% of the insured value per year and are paid up front in USD. A Trident Services Fee of up to 0.25% annually (first $250k waived) is billed monthly so you can size coverage to your treasury."
    },
    {
      "q": "How fast can I move bitcoin out of an AnchorWatch vault?",
      "a": "You prepare and sign the spend in Trident, submit your evidence package, and AnchorWatch usually clears compliance plus its signature within one to two business days. Plan larger withdrawals ahead so insurance controls never become a surprise bottleneck."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does AnchorWatch require KYC and where is it available?",
      "a": "Yes. AnchorWatch underwrites regulated US policies, so onboarding requires identity documents or KYB packages and they currently insure only US-based clients."
    },
    {
      "q": "How are customer keys and funds segregated at AnchorWatch?",
      "a": "You generate your own keys on factory-sealed devices, and each vault has a unique output descriptor that proves funds are never commingled with other policyholders. You can verify segregation on-chain before depositing sats."

  "description": "AnchorWatch is a U.S.-based bitcoin custody and insurance provider trying to bridge traditional insurance with Bitcoin-native custody, delivering peace of mind by offering an elegant, turnkey solution for long-term bitcoin holders and corporate treasuries seeking secure, insured, and inheritance-ready custody.\n\nWhat separates AnchorWatch is their unique integration of protocol-level multisig vaults with time-locked recovery and insurance. Users hold a multi-signature key set alongside AnchorWatch; both are required to sign transactions, and over time additional recovery mechanisms activate to handle key-loss, death, or coercion scenarios.\n\nUser reviews and discussions (e.g. from the Build With Bitcoin transcript) emphasize AnchorWatch's layered approach: the combination of vault tech and insurance addresses both technical and human vulnerabilities. The service also supports inheritance planning—time-locked access for heirs without cumbersome \"treasure maps\". This focus on estate continuity is cited as a major differentiator, especially for non-technical beneficiaries.\n\nTheir future vision includes expanding beyond U.S. customers, offering bespoke large-value enterprise policies, and exploring Bitcoin-denominated insurance.",
