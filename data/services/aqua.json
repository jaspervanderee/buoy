  "description": "Aqua Wallet, originally launched by Blockstream, later taken over by Jan3, is a mobile app designed for easy saving and spending in Bitcoin. It's a non-custodial, open-source wallet using a 12-word seed phrase for user control, and a unified balance across on-chain Bitcoin, Lightning, and Liquid Network transactions, defaulting to Liquid for low-fee, private payments. It offers sending, receiving, and swapping Bitcoin (on-chain to Liquid or vice versa) but for Lightning payments they rely on Boltz, a third party which can occur higher swap fees. This might affect daily usability for some users.\\n\\nThe app has an intuitive interface - although the design could use some work - and offers seamless swaps between on-chain Bitcoin and Lightning or Liquid.\\n\\nJAN3's mission is to onboard billions to Bitcoin, with a vision to expand Aqua with debit card integration, credit/loans, and global on/off-ramps. Beginners love its simple setup and versatility, but some find stablecoin options and swap fees confusing.",
