The app is self-custodial, so you write down a 12-word seed and control every transaction.\n\nAqua leans on Liquid for privacy and low fees, while Boltz swaps unlock Lightning spending without running your own channels. You can peg-in on-chain BTC, hold USDt on Liquid, and bridge to other networks when required.\n\nOptional extras such as the Dolphin Card and future marketplace services build on the same wallet, so newcomers can start with simple payments and grow into more advanced features as they get comfortable.",
