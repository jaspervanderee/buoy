    {
      "q": "How do I reach the StartOS dashboard on day one?",
      "a": "Connect your Server One, Server Pure, or DIY box to power plus Ethernet, keep your laptop or phone on the same LAN, and visit `http://start.local` to run the Start Fresh wizard. The UI walks you through choosing Start Fresh or Recovery so the device can provision itself."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do Start9 backups work?",
      "a": "Open System → Create Backup, pick a physical drive or SMB network folder, enter your master password, and StartOS writes an encrypted archive while warning you to favor high-endurance storage. You can continue using the server while the job runs and confirm the timestamp under System → Backups."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I trust the StartOS Root CA for HTTPS?",
      "a": "Download the Root CA during onboarding, from the startos-info file, or later via System → Root CA, then follow the Linux/Mac/Windows/Android/iOS instructions to import it. Once installed, browsers open your `.local` URLs over HTTPS without warnings."
    },
    {
      "q": "What hardware does StartOS support?",
      "a": "StartOS boots on Raspberry Pi and most x86_64 hardware, but the DIY guide warns Pis struggle with Bitcoin workloads, so plan for at least 8 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD on x86 if you need a full node. Lightweight services like password vaults or file shares can still live on Pi kits using high-endurance microSD cards."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I recover after a disk failure?",
      "a": "Flash StartOS, choose Recover, then pick Use Existing Drive, Transfer, or Restore from Backup to load your encrypted data onto the new disk. Transfer mode copies everything from the old drive to a larger replacement so your Tor and LAN addresses remain unchanged."

  "description": "Start9 (Start9 Labs) is the creator of the Embassy—a turnkey, self-hosted personal server and Bitcoin stack powered by their open-source StartOS. Their mission is to eliminate reliance on centralized third parties, placing privacy, decentralization, and individual autonomy at the forefront. Unlike other DIY solutions, Start9 aims to \"level the playing field,\" offering plug-and-play hardware kits (like Server One and Server Pure) or a do-it-yourself image for Raspberry Pi or x86, all fully supported by their first-class community and expert support team.\\n\\nStart9's target users are privacy-conscious individuals, Bitcoiners, and anyone seeking digital autonomy without sacrificing usability. They prioritize delivering polished self-sovereign computing with high-quality hardware, intuitive interfaces, and expert support (via Matrix) to onboard less technical users while remaining fully transparent and open-source. Users appreciate its robust foundation, modular update system (allowing single-service patching), backup ease, and strong headless health checking—compared to alternatives like Umbrel.\\n\\nLooking forward, Start9 envisions a world where personal servers become the backbone of a sovereign internet and smart homes, enabling blockchain-native apps, decentralized messaging, password managers, file storage, and more. Their open hardware and software philosophy ensures that even if the company disappears, the ecosystem lives on—fully community-driven and censorship-resistant.",
