  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How do RoboSats Lightning bonds and escrow work?",
      "a": "Each contract starts with the maker posting a Lightning hold-invoice bond—defaults to ~3% of the trade—and the taker matching it when they join, while the seller locks the sats in a hold invoice escrow. That lock keeps funds frozen until both parties confirm fiat, which means you can complete the trade and reclaim everything or cancel during the timer if the peer stalls."
    },
    {
      "q": "What fees does RoboSats charge on trades?",
      "a": "RoboSats collects 0.2% per completed trade, split 0.1% to the maker and 0.1% to the taker when the hold invoice settles. That sits on top of whatever spread you negotiate, so you can tighten your offers to keep the total cost in sats low."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does RoboSats require KYC or accounts?",
      "a": "Instead of accounts, RoboSats generates a one-time robot avatar from a secret token you control and stores only that token locally. That keeps your personal data off the coordinator, and you can rotate a fresh robot for every trade to keep orders unlinkable."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which Lightning wallets work best with RoboSats?",
      "a": "You need a Lightning wallet that can issue invoices and hold payments for a few minutes; RoboSats docs highlight Zeus, Blixt, Phoenix, Breez, Mutiny, and BlueWallet (LDK) because they keep the bond open until fiat clears. That support prevents premature expiry, and you can keep a second wallet with inbound liquidity ready if your main one is routing a large trade."
    },
    {
      "q": "How are disputes handled if a counterparty does not release sats?",
      "a": "If fiat fails, you hit Dispute in the chat, upload the payment proof, and the coordinator reviews both bond invoices plus your evidence. Their ruling routes the trade hold invoice either to you or the counterparty, so you can recover funds when you documented the fiat leg."

  "description": "RoboSats is a privacy‑first, Lightning‑native peer‑to‑peer exchange for buying and selling bitcoin with fiat. It is open‑source, requires no registration or KYC, and runs primarily over Tor (with I2P and an Android app available). Each trade uses a one‑time “robot” identity tied to a secret token you control, and all peer chat is end‑to‑end encrypted with PGP. The flow is simple: make or take an order, both sides lock small Lightning bonds, the seller locks a Lightning hold‑invoice escrow, fiat moves, then sats are released.\n\nWhat separates RoboSats is how deeply privacy and safety are built into the mechanics rather than bolted on. One‑trade identities reduce linkability across orders, PGP‑sealed chat prevents metadata leakage, and Lightning hold invoices act as both escrow and fidelity bonds to discourage cancellations and fraud. Pricing is transparent and market‑relative, fees are low at 0.2% split between maker and taker, and optional on‑chain payouts are handled via swaps. Clear best‑practice guides help users pick lower‑risk fiat rails and avoid chargeback traps.\n\nThe ideal audience is anyone who wants fast, low‑fee, no‑KYC bitcoin for modest amounts and is comfortable using Tor and a compatible Lightning wallet. Trade sizes are tuned to what routes reliably on Lightning today, which suits frequent smaller buys and sells. The UI is straightforward once you learn the token/robot model, and the documentation walks through wallet compatibility, order timing, disputes, and payment‑method hygiene to keep trades quick and clean.\n\nRoboSats’ vision is to keep P2P bitcoin simple, private, and resilient, with a path toward a federated network of coordinators sharing a unified order book to reduce single‑operator risk while preserving the familiar UX.",
