  "description": "Breez (Misty Breez) focuses on making Lightning Network payments fast and easy. It stands out with its non-custodial mobile app, letting users control their Bitcoin, and a unique Point-of-Sale mode for merchants to accept instant payments. It offers sending, receiving, and storing Bitcoin via Lightning, plus a podcast player to support creators with Bitcoin tips.\\n\\nThe app has a simple interface and no-setup payments, though some users report issues with cloud backups and wallet restoration.\\n\\nBreez's mission is to drive Bitcoin adoption for everyday use, with a vision to expand Lightning payments across apps using its Breez SDK, a free developer tool. The app currently suits everyday payments rather than very small transactions. Beginners love its ease and merchant tools, but some find technical issues frustrating.",
