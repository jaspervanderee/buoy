      "q": "What fees apply when I pay over Lightning?",
      "a": "Breez passes along the network's routing fees (like a toll) and lets you cap them under Preferences > Lightning Fees; the app itself doesn't add extra charges to everyday sends."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens if I don't have enough capacity to receive?",
      "a": "Breez automatically sets up a new channel for you and charges 0.4% of the amount plus the current Bitcoin network fee when more capacity is needed."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does Breez back up my wallet?",
      "a": "Each time you make a payment or generate an address, Breez encrypts your channel data and saves it to your cloud account (Google Drive, iCloud, Nextcloud, or any WebDAV provider) so you can restore everything if you lose your phone."
    },
    {
      "q": "How can I restore Breez after losing my phone?",
      "a": "Install Breez on your new device, sign in with the recovery key and cloud account you set up, then keep the app open while it downloads your backup and rebuilds your channels."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Breez support on-chain transactions?",

  "description": "Breez is a beginner-friendly Lightning wallet designed to make everyday bitcoin payments effortless on mobile. The app runs a Lightning node behind the scenes, pairing a simple interface with automatic channel management so anyone can spend or receive sats in seconds.\n\nBeyond standard wallet features, Breez adds a merchant-focused Point-of-Sale mode, podcast streaming with bitcoin tips, and one-tap Lightning addresses. Instant channel setups and automatic swaps keep the experience seamless while Breez encrypts your channel data to your cloud account after every payment.\n\nCompared with Phoenix's recovery phrase backups or Muun's dual on-chain approach, Breez focuses on automation: it handles all the technical channel work for you, but requires encrypted cloud backups and charges a 0.4% setup fee when new receiving capacity is needed.",
