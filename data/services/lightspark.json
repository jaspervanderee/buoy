    {
      "q": "How do Lightspark Connect fees work across Starter and Enterprise tiers?",
      "a": "Connect Starter routes every Lightning payment through Lightspark's managed nodes for 0.50% up to $300,000 in monthly volume. Enterprise plans add a $9,000-$15,000 platform retainer so you can drop per-transaction costs to roughly 0.30%-0.15% across $3-$15 million in monthly flow. You can start on Starter's free first 30 days and upgrade inside the dashboard once usage grows."
    },
    {
      "q": "When does Lightspark bill me for platform and overage fees?",
      "a": "Billing kicks in after the 30-day trial, when Lightspark invoices the platform fee for your tier at the beginning of each month. That same invoice lists any usage that exceeded your volume limits in the prior period so finance teams see one predictable charge. You can downgrade or pause before the next cycle if your run rate changes."
    },
    {
      "q": "How can I pay my Lightspark invoice?",
      "a": "Lightspark charges the card you keep on file five days after issuing the invoice, which removes manual payment work. Each invoice also includes a Lightning or on-chain Bitcoin link that locks the fiat amount in sats for 24 hours so you can settle with bitcoin instead. You can regenerate the payment quote from the invoice link whenever the price window expires."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I make payments from Lightspark?",
      "a": "Lightning payouts run through the Send flow or API/SDK while on-chain settlements use the Withdraw flow, so you choose the rail per transfer. That separation keeps instant Lightning transfers distinct from Bitcoin Layer 1 withdrawals that wait on block confirmations. You can set custom fee limits in the Send flow when you need to allow higher routing budgets."
    },
    {
      "q": "What protects my funds if Lightspark goes offline?",
      "a": "Passwords are recoverable through the Forgot your password link, but custody resilience comes from Lightspark's Funds Recovery Kit that generates pre-signed transactions. Once you configure the kit you can publish those transactions on Bitcoin Layer 1 to reclaim funds without waiting on Lightspark support. Treat the hosted stack as a bridge and store the recovery file offline so you always have an exit."

  "description": "Lightspark is a payments infrastructure company founded by David Marcus (formerly of PayPal, Meta, and Diem) in 2022. They aim to build what they call the \"Money Grid,\" a global, open payment network using Bitcoin as a neutral settlement layer and leveraging Lightning for high-speed transfers.\n\nTheir target audience includes enterprises—digital banks, fintechs, wallets, exchanges—that need to move money across currencies and jurisdictions instantly and cheaply, as well as developers building Bitcoin-native payment applications or self-custodial wallets that need scalable infrastructure.\n\nWhat sets Lightspark apart is their end-to-end product integration, combining seamless liquidity management, intelligent routing, compliance-ready infrastructure, and human-friendly Universal Money Address (UMA) tech. This abstraction lets banks, wallets, exchanges, and businesses effortlessly send and receive fiat or crypto globally without having to manage Lightning channels, cross-border FX, or complex on-chain details. These tools have already seen traction with big regulated partners and typically involves KYC via the partner.\n\nLooking forward, Lightspark's vision is to scale the Money Grid globally—connecting all real-time payment systems and making Bitcoin native rails for everything from everyday consumer transfers to B2B fiat-fiat flows. Spark aims to resolve key Lightning limitations like self-custody economic scalability and lacks native token support. By building Spark open-source and fully backward compatible with Lightning, they hope to decentralize stablecoin issuance on Bitcoin and finally realize high-velocity, global Bitcoin-based payment settlement.",
