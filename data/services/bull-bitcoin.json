    {
      "q": "How do Bull Bitcoin's buy and sell rates include fees?",
      "a": "Bull Bitcoin publishes an all-in CAD rate on its Rates page that already bakes in the spread, so the quote you confirm is what lands in your wallet. If you expect to cross $100,000 CAD in monthly volume you can request Bull Bitcoin Prime for tighter pricing."
    },
    {
      "q": "How fast do Interac e-Transfer buys reach my wallet on Bull Bitcoin?",
      "a": "As soon as Bull Bitcoin receives your Interac e-Transfer it broadcasts the payout over on-chain, Lightning, or Liquid, so the sats arrive within minutes. Pick the network before you confirm if you need instant Lightning delivery."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Bull Bitcoin require identity verification before I trade?",
      "a": "Bull Bitcoin is a FINTRAC-regulated MSB, which means you verify your ID and account before funding or requesting CAD payouts. Completing that step keeps them compliant while every buy still settles straight to your wallet."
    },
    {
      "q": "What payout options can I use when I sell bitcoin on Bull Bitcoin?",
      "a": "Bull Bitcoin locks your sell rate the moment your bitcoin arrives and can send CAD to a bank account, Interac recipient, credit card, or more than 14,000 Canadian billers. You can route the payout to yourself or nominate a third-party recipient inside Canada."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can Bull Bitcoin deliver bitcoin over Lightning or the Liquid Network?",
      "a": "Bull Bitcoin lets you paste a Bitcoin address, Lightning invoice, or Liquid address when you place a buy, so it settles on the network you choose. Use on-chain for larger orders and Lightning or Liquid when speed matters."

  "description": "Bull Bitcoin is a Canadian Bitcoin exchange that stands out by being entirely non-custodial, meaning users must provide their own wallet and take full ownership of their Bitcoin. It allows users to buy Bitcoin directly to their own wallets, sell Bitcoin instantly without waiting for confirmations, and even pay bills, rent, and credit cards in Canada by converting Bitcoin to fiat without relying on traditional banks. This approach positions Bitcoin as a tool for everyday exchange, not just long-term saving.\\n\\nThe platform (the mobile app is in beta) is self-funded, Bitcoin-only, and deeply ideological, rejecting external investors. Its team identifies as cypherpunks, building open-source tools and promoting financial sovereignty. Bull Bitcoin's mission is to create sovereign individuals through uncompromising adherence to Bitcoin principles, making it attractive to users who want to align their actions with their values.\\n\\nBeginners find the platform easy to use, with a clean interface and responsive support, while advanced users appreciate its strong privacy stance and no-compromise philosophy. It's ideal for Canadians and expanding internationally for those who want full control over their Bitcoin without depending on custodians or legacy finance systems.",
