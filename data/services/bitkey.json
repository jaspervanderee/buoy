    {
      "q": "How does Bitkey's 2-of-3 key system keep my bitcoin safe?",
      "a": "Bitkey splits control between the mobile key on your phone, a fingerprint hardware key, and a server key, and every send or security change needs two signatures. That means Block can never move funds alone while you still have a path to recover coins if one device fails."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is Bitkey's Cloud Recovery flow if I lose my phone?",
      "a": "The Bitkey app stores an encrypted copy of your mobile key inside your iCloud or Google Drive account, and the hardware key decrypts it. Install Bitkey on a new phone, sign into the same cloud account, tap the hardware key, and your wallet restores without seed phrases."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens when my Bitkey hardware is lost or damaged?",
      "a": "Start hardware recovery in the app and Bitkey triggers a seven-day security waiting period while SMS and email alerts confirm the request. After the hold, pair a replacement device or invite Recovery Contacts to approve sooner so you can co-sign again."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do Recovery Contacts help if I lose my phone and hardware?",
      "a": "You can pre-approve trusted contacts in the Bitkey app, and they install Bitkey, accept your invite, and agree to vouch for you. If both keys disappear, you share a code with them, they verify it inside their app, and that lets you rebuild your wallet on new hardware."
    },
    {
      "q": "When would I use the Bitkey Emergency Exit Kit?",
      "a": "The Emergency Exit Kit is a signed Android utility plus an encrypted mobile key backup stored in your cloud drive. If Bitkey's infrastructure ever goes offline, you sideload the kit, tap your hardware key, and sweep your bitcoin to any address you control."

  "description": "Bitkey is a mobile and hardware wallet developed by Block and designed for people new to Bitcoin who want simple, secure self-custody. The system combines a phone app with a wireless hardware device and an encrypted cloud backup, using a 2-of-3 multisig model to keep users in control of their funds. This structure allows users to recover access even if they lose their phone or the device, adding safety without relying on seed phrases.\\n\\nThe hardware, a sleek hexagonal device with a fingerprint sensor and NFC for phone pairing, eliminates the need for complex seed phrases, making it user-friendly. Sending Bitcoin requires both your phone and the Bitkey device, while smaller transactions can be approved using just your phone and Bitkey's server key if you've set spending limits. This balance appeals to people who want more security than just a phone wallet but don't want the complexity of most hardware wallets.\\n\\nUsers can set daily spending limits for app-only transactions, adding flexibility. The setup is quick, often taking just 5 minutes, and the app's clean interface is intuitive. The app allows Bitcoin purchases, shows balance in both sats and fiat, and offers recovery through trusted contacts in case of loss. It also lacks a screen, meaning you can't visually verify addresses on the hardware itself.\\n\\nBitkey's mission is to bring secure Bitcoin ownership to a global audience, especially those new to Bitcoin, by removing friction and avoiding the pitfalls of traditional backups. Their future vision includes broader international support, expanded wallet functionality, and continued emphasis on open-source development and user control. For beginners, Bitkey offers a straightforward, secure way to own Bitcoin with a polished user experience, though advanced users may want more flexibility.",
