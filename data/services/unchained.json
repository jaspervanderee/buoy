    {
      "q": "How does Unchained's 2-of-3 collaborative custody work?",
      "a": "You hold two private keys on separate hardware wallets, and Unchained holds a third backup key. Moving funds requires two signatures, which means you maintain full control (using your two keys) while Unchained can help you recover funds (using their key plus one of yours) if you lose a device."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens if Unchained goes out of business?",
      "a": "Since you hold two of the three keys, you can always move your bitcoin without Unchained's permission or participation. You can use their open-source tool, Caravan, or other multisig wallets like Sparrow to recover your funds using your own keys and backup file."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Unchained require KYC documents?",
      "a": "Yes. Because Unchained is a regulated US financial institution that offers trading, IRAs, and loans, you must provide identity verification (drivers license, SSN) to open an account, even for the basic vault service."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use my existing hardware wallets with Unchained?",
      "a": "Yes. Unchained supports most major devices including Trezor, Coldcard, and Ledger. You don't need to buy special hardware; you just export the public keys from your existing devices to build the vault."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does the Unchained Inheritance Protocol work?",
      "a": "You designate a beneficiary and customized plan today. If you pass away, Unchained guides your beneficiary through a secure verification process and uses their backup key to co-sign a transaction, transferring the funds to them without requiring you to share your private keys while you are alive."

  "description": "Unchained is a Bitcoin financial services company focused on helping individuals and businesses secure their Bitcoin through collaborative custody. Their main product is a multisig vault that uses a 2-of-3 key setup, where the user holds two keys and Unchained holds the third. This setup allows users to maintain full control over their Bitcoin while enabling Unchained to assist in recovery if needed, without ever having unilateral access to the funds.\n\nWhat makes Unchained unique is its emphasis on combining technical security with user support. Unlike standard hardware wallet setups that rely on a single point of failure, Unchained's model is resistant to user error and device loss. Even if you lose 75% of your devices or backups, you can still recover your funds with Unchained's help. Their system also facilitates inheritance by allowing next of kin to recover funds with proper documentation, making it especially appealing for those thinking about long-term wealth protection.\n\nUnchained users appreciate the guided onboarding, live support, and optional concierge services that simplify the complex process of setting up multisig. The platform integrates with popular hardware wallets, and allows users to manage their funds through Unchained's dashboard or export and interact with their vault using open-source tools. The ability to spend from your vault without relying on the Unchained website gives users additional peace of mind.\n\nThe company's long-term vision is to build a robust financial ecosystem based on Bitcoin-native tools, including multisig-secured lending, inheritance planning, and business services. While the setup requires ID verification and Unchained knows the vault balances, many users view this trade-off as acceptable in exchange for improved recovery options and strong operational security.\n\nUnchained is best suited for those seeking to remove single points of failure in their Bitcoin custody, want professional assistance when needed, and value redundancy and inheritance planning—all while retaining full self-custody.",
