  "description": "Umbrel bundles Bitcoin Core, Lightning daemons, and a catalog of home-server apps into a single dashboard you host on your own hardware. Because your node verifies blocks locally, you no longer depend on third-party APIs for mempool data or wallet balances, and the App Store manages containers for tools like Electrs, Mempool, BTCPay, or even photo libraries without touching the command line.\n\nThat convenience comes with trade-offs. Umbrel keeps its UI on HTTP inside your LAN, uses a source-available license, and manages updates centrally, so you inherit their defaults unless you harden the stack with Tor-only access, VLAN isolation, and custom reverse proxies. You can export backups, disable telemetry, and lock down SSH, but long-term safety still depends on how you provision hardware, power, and backups.\n\nUse Umbrel when you want a polished, guided path into running your own Bitcoin stack alongside other self-hosted services. If you need reproducible builds, deterministic updates, or air-gapped security policies, treat Umbrel as a starter kit and graduate to a more open stack once you’re comfortable maintaining the moving pieces.",
