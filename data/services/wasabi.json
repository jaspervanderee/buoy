    {
      "q": "Can I still use CoinJoin with Wasabi Wallet in 2025?",
      "a": "The zkSNACKs coordinator shut down June 1, 2024, so the default CoinJoin option is no longer available. Wasabi continues as a privacy-focused wallet with Tor, coin control, and PayJoin. Community-run coordinators may emerge."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Wasabi Wallet always run over Tor?",
      "a": "The desktop app launches with Tor routing and client-side block filters so your IP address and balances never hit a third-party server. You can toggle Tor off for troubleshooting, but privacy drops immediately when you do."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can Wasabi Wallet connect to hardware wallets or my own node?",
      "a": "Wasabi talks to the open-source Hardware Wallet Interface and can point at Bitcoin Core or Electrum, which keeps signing on dedicated devices while your node answers address lookups. Turn those integrations on if you want end-to-end self verification."
    },
    {
      "q": "What fees should I expect when using Wasabi Wallet?",
      "a": "The software is free, every transaction still pays the standard mining fee, and CoinJoin rounds add roughly a 0.3% coordinator fee for inputs above 0.01 BTC while smaller inputs only pay miners. You can delay mixes or spend unmixed coins when privacy is less critical."
    },
    {
      "q": "What do I need to recover a Wasabi Wallet?",
      "a": "Wasabi encrypts your wallet with the 12-word seed plus the optional passphrase, so you must restore with both pieces to regain control. Store them separately and test a dry-run recovery before you trust the wallet with real savings."

  "description": "Wasabi Wallet is a privacy-focused, open-source, non‑custodial Bitcoin desktop wallet launched by zkSNACKs. It routes all traffic through Tor and uses compact blockchain filters, keeping your IP and balance private. With the 2024 sunset of the zkSNACKs CoinJoin coordinator, Wasabi now focuses on powerful manual coin control, PayJoin, and hardware wallet integration for privacy management.\n\nThe user interface is straightforward but functional, with a dashboard showing your balance, privacy progress, and transaction history, though it may feel technical for complete beginners. Setup involves writing down a 12-word seed phrase and an optional passphrase, which adds security but requires careful storage.\n\nWasabi is for people who want to own their Bitcoin without having to trust big companies. It runs silently in the background over Tor and gives you full control—all on your own computer. Its goal is to make privacy easy and powerful, while building toward a future where you don't rely on any single server.",
