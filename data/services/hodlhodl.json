    {
      "q": "How do Hodl Hodl trading fees work?",
      "a": "Hodl Hodl caps its trading fee at 0.5% and splits it equally between the buyer and seller when the contract closes. You see the fee in the contract preview before you lock funds so you can decide whether the price still fits your trade."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Hodl Hodl require KYC verification?",
      "a": "Hodl Hodl lets you sign up with an email and start trading without submitting identity documents. Higher reputation still helps your pricing, so you can choose optional verification only if counterparties request it."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does Hodl Hodl multisig escrow keep trades secure?",
      "a": "Each trade locks bitcoin in a unique 2-of-3 multisig address controlled by you, the counterparty, and Hodl Hodl support. If a dispute happens, either you or support can co-sign the release so the contract settles even if the site goes offline."
    },
    {
      "q": "What payment methods can I use on Hodl Hodl?",
      "a": "Sellers post over 1,000 payment methods ranging from bank transfers and Wise to cash in person, with availability filtered by currency and country. You can sort offers by payment type to match whatever rails you already trust."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are Hodl Hodl trading limits and how do I increase them?",
      "a": "New accounts start on the first limit tier with smaller trade caps until you complete contracts and earn reviews. As your reputation score climbs you unlock higher daily and lifetime limits, and you can request manual increases for high volume deals."

  "description": "Hodl Hodl is a peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace that removes the custodial step most exchanges require. When you buy or sell on a typical platform, the exchange holds your funds and decides when you can withdraw. That reintroduces the same counterparty risk Bitcoin was designed to eliminate. Hodl Hodl takes a different approach: each trade locks bitcoin in a 2-of-3 multisig escrow that you, the counterparty, and Hodl Hodl support control together. Neither side can move the funds alone, which means trades settle directly between wallets without Hodl Hodl ever holding custody. That shifts trust from a centralized company to verifiable on-chain contracts.\n\nYou can sign up with an email and start trading without submitting identity documents. Hodl Hodl supports over 100 fiat currencies and lets sellers post offers using bank transfers, cash in person, Revolut, PayPal, and other payment rails you already trust. Premiums vary by offer and tend to be higher for new accounts until you complete a few trades and build reputation. The platform uses a limit tier system: as your reputation score grows through successful contracts and reviews, you unlock higher daily and lifetime trading caps.\n\nThe web interface is straightforward. You filter offers by country, currency, and payment method, read the seller's instructions, and open a contract. Both parties chat inside the contract, upload payment proof, and coordinate the release once fiat clears. If something breaks, you can open a dispute and Hodl Hodl support co-signs the multisig based on the evidence. A Testnet environment lets you rehearse the full workflow with valueless coins before risking real sats, so you learn the escrow flow, chat prompts, and dispute process without capital at stake.\n\nHodl Hodl fits users who want non-custodial trading and are comfortable managing their own wallets, confirming payments, and negotiating premiums. You bring your own Bitcoin wallet to every trade, which means no withdrawal limits or custodial freezes. The trade-off is that you handle more of the process yourself compared to a custodial exchange that automates order matching and holds funds. Choose Hodl Hodl when self-custody and privacy matter more than instant card funding or automated recurring buys.",
