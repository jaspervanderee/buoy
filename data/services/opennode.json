  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How does OpenNode's hosted checkout work?",
      "a": "When you create a charge, OpenNode returns a checkout URL that bundles the Lightning invoice and on-chain address so customers can choose their rail. That means you can simply redirect to checkout.opennode.com/{id} and append ln or hf query switches to shape the experience."
    },
    {
      "q": "What fees does OpenNode charge for processing and withdrawals?",
      "a": "OpenNode charges around 1% for processing plus on-demand on-chain withdrawals, while scheduled weekly transfers stay free and Lightning withdrawals are free. You can choose instant payouts when speed matters or lean on scheduled moves if you want to avoid the extra fee."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does OpenNode handle underpaid invoices?",
      "a": "You can set an underpayment tolerance so slightly short on-chain payments move forward automatically, and anything below the threshold is flagged as underpaid. Buyers can send the remaining sats or request a refund that returns their funds minus the 200 sat network fee, so you stay in control of the customer experience."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can OpenNode pay Lightning invoices from my fiat balance?",
      "a": "Yes. Wire fiat into your OpenNode local currency wallet and initiate Lightning or on-chain payouts directly from that balance. The platform quotes the BTC amount and handles conversion so you can fund global payouts without ever holding bitcoin on your books."
    },
    {
      "q": "What verification does OpenNode require?",
      "a": "Individual accounts submit government ID plus a fresh selfie, while businesses provide formation docs, ownership records, and proof of address so OpenNode can meet KYB obligations. That onboarding is what unlocks higher limits, fiat rails, and access to payout APIs."

  "description": "OpenNode is a Bitcoin-first payment processor that empowers businesses to accept and send Bitcoin—either on-chain or via Lightning—using simple plugins, hosted checkouts, or its developer-friendly API. Organisations that want a turnkey, compliant solution—especially mid-sized to large enterprises—can onboard easily with KYC and achieve global scale without building complex node infrastructure.\\n\\nIt offers instant, low-cost microtransactions with a focus on liquidity management, channel operations, and protocol support. For merchants, this means accessing Bitcoin payments both instantly and economically, alongside automatic settlement options in fiat or BTC. By abstracting away technical complexities like node handling, liquidity, and channel balance, OpenNode allows businesses to plug-and-play and scale efficiently.\\n\\nIt holds US regulatory licenses, manages KYC requirements, and maintains automated fiat conversions and payouts. This makes it ideal for businesses—especially blue-chip and enterprise-level—that require solid legal and financial backstops.\\n\\nTheir long-term vision is to see global businesses and platforms integrate Bitcoin payments as seamlessly as credit cards—secure, censorship-resistant, and frictionless—while pushing forward broader adoption of Bitcoin as a unit of exchange across borders and cultures.",
