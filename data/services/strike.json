    {
      "q": "How do Strike's bitcoin trading fees work?",
      "a": "Strike charges a tiered Strike fee that starts at 0.99% for monthly volume under $250 and steps down to 0.39% once you trade more than $15,000,000. Recurring purchases skip the fee after the first cycle for hourly or daily schedules and after the second run for weekly or monthly schedules."
    },
    {
      "q": "When are ACH deposits available to withdraw?",
      "a": "ACH deposits post instantly for trading but sit in your pending balance until the transfer settles, which typically takes about five business days plus any extra hold Strike applies based on your history. Once the deposit moves to available balance you can send, spend, or withdraw it."
    },
    {
      "q": "Are Lightning withdrawals free?",
      "a": "Yes. Lightning withdrawals from your available bitcoin balance have no Strike fee and settle instantly once your ACH or card deposit has cleared."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do bitcoin auto-withdrawals work?",
      "a": "You can set a threshold between 1,000,000 and 500,000,000 sats along with one or more payout addresses. When your available balance crosses the threshold Strike queues the full amount, gives you a 12 hour window to cancel, then broadcasts within 24 hours using the fee-free Flexible tier."
    },
    {
      "q": "Where is Strike available today?",
      "a": "Strike is available across the United States except New York, Puerto Rico, and in more than 95 other countries. Availability and payment methods vary, so confirm support in your local App Store or on the Strike website."

  "description": "Strike is a custodial bitcoin app focused on fast buys and cash like payments. The mobile interface puts bank, card, and direct deposit funding beside instant Lightning withdrawals, so you can move from fiat to bitcoin and back with minimal steps.\n\nFunding options cover fee-free ACH, debit cards with a small processor fee, and same day wires. ACH deposits trade instantly yet stay pending for roughly five business days before you can withdraw, while wires settle in about one business day and debit card purchases clear immediately.\n\nRecurring purchases waive the Strike fee after the first cycle, and optional auto-withdrawals move your balance to self custody once it reaches the threshold you set. Customer prompts inside the app highlight fee tiers, settlement speed, and the 12 hour cancel window Strike gives you before broadcasting auto-withdrawals.",
