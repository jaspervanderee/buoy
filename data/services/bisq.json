    {
      "q": "How do Bisq trading fees and BSQ discounts work?",
      "a": "Bisq sets maker fees at 0.15% and taker fees at 1.15% when you pay in BTC, and the DAO halves each rate to 0.075% and 0.575% if you spend BSQ. You can choose the fee currency before confirming a trade and see the exact total on the review screen."
    },
    {
      "q": "What security deposit do Bisq trades require?",
      "a": "Every trade locks both parties' refundable security deposits in a 2-of-2 multisig escrow alongside the trade amount. Deposit sizes vary by payment method and account signing stage, and Bisq shows the required amount before you accept an offer."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which payment methods can I use on Bisq worldwide?",
      "a": "Bisq supports rails such as SEPA, Zelle, Wise, Revolut, and cash trades, each with its own settlement window and trade limit. You can filter the offer book by payment method to find rails that match your country."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Bisq require identity verification or accounts?",
      "a": "Bisq runs over Tor with no central accounts or KYC, so your payment profiles and trade history stay on your computer. You share the needed details only with your counterparty during the trade."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long do Bisq trades take to settle?",
      "a": "A Bisq trade waits for the escrow transaction to confirm on-chain, then gives you a payment window that ranges from minutes on crypto rails to four to six days on fiat rails. Once both sides mark payment sent and received, the escrow releases and your deposit returns automatically."

  "description": "Bisq is a decentralized, open‑source desktop app created by Manfred Karrer for buying and selling bitcoin directly with other people. It routes all traffic over Tor, uses a built‑in non‑custodial wallet and has no sign‑ups or KYC. Trades span many national currencies and payment rails, and the project is funded and governed through a community DAO with the BSQ token rather than a company.\n\nWhat separates Bisq is its security and incentive design for fiat‑to‑BTC P2P. Each trade locks both sides’ refundable security deposits in a 2‑of‑2 multisig escrow. Account‑age and signing rules gradually raise per‑trade limits to reduce chargeback risk, and a small amount of bitcoin is required up front to cover fees and deposits. Trading fees are transparent and lower if paid in BSQ. It’s desktop‑first by design; the mobile app is for notifications.\n\nUser feedback highlights Bisq’s strengths in privacy, censorship resistance and self‑custody, along with clear, step‑by‑step trade flows and a multi‑stage dispute process if things go wrong.\n\nThe trade‑offs are thinner liquidity depending on region, wider spreads than convenience brokers, the need to already have a little bitcoin, and settlement times tied to the chosen fiat method and counterparties’ availability. Some users note that disputes can take time, and that desktop performance varies by setup.\n\nBisq’s target audience is privacy‑minded bitcoiners and anyone who needs a resilient, non‑custodial fiat ramp. The roadmap is to keep the marketplace permissionless while improving UX and resilience: Bisq 2 introduces a simpler “Bisq Easy” path alongside the familiar multisig protocol, support for multiple privacy networks, and optional use of Liquid for faster, lower‑fee settlement.",
