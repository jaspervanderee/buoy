    {
      "q": "How do Swan's bitcoin purchase fees work?",
      "a": "Swan waives fees on your first $10,000 in lifetime buys, then charges 1% on each additional buy or sell. Auto-withdrawals keep Swan Safe custody fees waived so you do not pay the optional 0.03% monthly charge."
    },
    {
      "q": "When are ACH deposits available to withdraw from Swan?",
      "a": "ACH purchases under $1,000 typically unlock in 10–15 days (closer to 5–10 days once your account is seasoned), while larger ACH purchases unlock in 20–30 days; wires and bitcoin deposits settle within about 24 hours. Use the “Available to withdraw” banner in your dashboard to see exact dates."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does Swan charge for bitcoin withdrawals?",
      "a": "Swan does not add a platform fee when you withdraw bitcoin; you simply pick the on-chain fee tier that matches the speed you want. USD wires carry a $15 fee with a $50,000 minimum if you move cash instead of bitcoin."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do Swan auto-withdrawals work?",
      "a": "Add a wallet address under Withdrawals, enable two-factor authentication, and set the on-chain balance threshold that fits your cadence. Once your unlocked balance crosses that mark, Swan queues an on-chain withdrawal to that address."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who holds custody of bitcoin bought on Swan?",
      "a": "Swan opens an individually titled account for you with regulated custodians Bakkt, BitGo, or Equity Trust, and those partners do not lend or rehypothecate customer coins. You can leave funds there temporarily or withdraw to your own wallet whenever you are ready."

  "description": "Swan Bitcoin, launched by Cory Klippsten and based in California, is a platform focused on making it easy for beginners to buy and save Bitcoin.\n\nWhat makes Swan distinct is its focus on self-custody support and education. It automatically withdraws BTC weekly to your own address and provides guides for self-custody, while also offering Swan Guard with fraud protection and identity verification tools. Swan prioritizes teaching users about Bitcoin's value for financial freedom. Swan also targets long-term savers by offering IRA products making Bitcoin tax-advantaged retirement savings easier.\n\nSwan offers zero-fee purchases on the first $10,000, a low 0.99% fee for recurring buys, and free withdrawals to personal wallets, encouraging self-custody. Its app is praised for its clean design and simple setup. However, some users report slow customer support and issues with account restrictions.\n\nIts vision is to onboard 10 million Bitcoin users by promoting Bitcoin as better money for a decentralized future.",
