  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How do Fold rewards differ by plan?",
      "a": "Fold's Basic plan lets you spin the Rewards Wheel, buy gift cards, and refer friends for sats, while Fold+ subscribers add guaranteed 0.5% back on signature Visa purchases, 1.5%-5% rotating Card and Merchant Boosts, and ACH Bill Pay rewards."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do ACH Bill Pay rewards work?",
      "a": "Fold+ members earn 0.25%-1.5% back on ACH Bill Payments up to the amount of the previous month's qualified spend-the first $2,500 in payments uses your tier rate, dollars $2,501-$5,000 revert to 0.25%, and anything beyond last month's spend earns 0%. Qualified spend includes bitcoin buys, gift cards purchased with your Fold balance (counted 2x), and Visa Signature transactions that only received the base 0.5% reward."
    },
    {
      "q": "What limits apply to the Fold Card?",
      "a": "As of September 5, 2024 the Fold Card caps include a $30,000 account balance, $15,000 per-day spend, $15,000 per calendar-day loads, a $2,000 rolling 24-hour gift card limit, and $250 per ATM transaction ($1,000 per day/month). Instant debit transfers cap at $1,500 per deposit and depend on how long you have held Fold+."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is the Fold Card FDIC insured?",
      "a": "USD on the Fold Card is issued by Sutton Bank, Member FDIC, so balances qualify for pass-through FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per ownership category when eligibility conditions are met. Bitcoin balances, rewards, and gift card value are not FDIC or SIPC protected."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long does Push to Card take and what does it cost?",
      "a": "Push to Card sells bitcoin inside Fold and loads USD to your Fold Card; Fold+ members pay no fee, Basic users pay a 1% sell fee, and transfers usually settle in 1-10 minutes (rarely up to 24 hours)."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I withdraw bitcoin from Fold?",
      "a": "Open the Bitcoin tab, tap Send -> Withdraw, paste or scan your destination address, and confirm; the only cost is the Bitcoin network miner fee. Most withdrawals finalize within 1-2 hours, and Fold asks you to contact support if a transfer hasn't landed after 24 hours."

  "description": "Fold aims to make Bitcoin accessible by integrating it into daily financial activities. It offers a Visa prepaid debit card, gift card purchases, and bill payments, all rewarding users with Bitcoin (sats). Users can also buy Bitcoin with low or no fees, depending on their plan, and deposit Bitcoin into their Fold account for insured custody.\n\nWhat sets Fold apart is how it combines traditional finance functions like bill pay and debit card usage with Bitcoin rewards in one simple interface. Users don't need to juggle multiple apps or wallets. Rewards can be earned on nearly every transaction, from daily spending to mortgage payments, with bonus sats for gift card purchases. Fold also allows external Bitcoin deposits and provides low-fee conversions from paycheck to BTC, making it easy to live on a Bitcoin standard while minimizing taxable events.\n\nUsers praise the ease of use, the ability to stack Bitcoin passively, and the clear design of the app. Some power users run most of their household finances through Fold, using the gift card section for groceries and shopping, and setting up recurring buys with leftover balances at the end of each month. The ability to earn rewards even on ACH bill pay is seen as a unique benefit.\n\nFold's vision is to be the ultimate platform for living on a Bitcoin standard, making it easy to earn, spend, and save Bitcoin while navigating a fiat world, giving users control and flexibility without the complexity of traditional exchanges or wallets.",
