    {
      "q": "How does Pocket deliver bitcoin to my wallet?",
      "a": "Pocket executes your buy on Kraken and broadcasts the payout straight to the address you confirmed, using the lowest mining fee it can attach. You can watch the transaction land in your wallet without waiting for a withdrawal queue."
    },
    {
      "q": "What service fee does Pocket charge on each purchase?",
      "a": "Pocket applies a 1.5% service fee that covers all operating costs without touching the exchange rate. You can confirm the calculation on the payout screen before your transfer settles."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does Pocket manage bitcoin network fees?",
      "a": "Pocket batches many customer payouts into one transaction so each order only pays a share of the mining fee, which usually lands around 500–1000 sats. You can reuse the same address for multiple transfers in a day when you want those payouts to share a fee."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which exchange rate does Pocket pass through?",
      "a": "Pocket routes every buy through Kraken at the live market price and passes that rate to you without a hidden spread. You can match their timestamp against Kraken's public order book for verification."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I schedule recurring buys that settle to my wallet?",
      "a": "Pocket lets you set up one-off or auto-invest bank transfers that pay out directly to your own wallet instead of a custodial balance. You can build a position over time while staying in control of your keys."
