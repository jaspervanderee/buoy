Interview #1
Bases International Foundation — “We are in fold 34: How exponential change will rewrite economics”

Theme: Exponential tech colliding with a credit system that can’t allow deflation

1) Fold 34 thinking: why our models fail.
I open with the paper-folding riddle for a reason: almost everyone guesses “inches,” not “the sun.” We’re wired for linear thinking, yet technology doubles—relentlessly. Early in the curve we overestimate impact (hype cycles); later, we underestimate by a staggering degree. If we’re around “fold 34,” 18 more months means another double. We don’t predict the future—we project the present forward. That’s why incumbents get blindsided and why most economists miss what entrepreneurs exploit: the compounding nature of digital progress.

2) Technology gives “more for less”—which is deflation.
Transistors jump from thousands to tens of billions; chips get faster while using less power. A $600 component becomes a $5 bill of materials. Photos, music, calculators, maps, editing suites—everything turns into information, and information trends toward its marginal cost: ~free. Rational actors choose value, so markets migrate to the best deal. That broad shift is deflationary by nature. It’s good. It’s how society should capture productivity gains.

3) The collision: deflationary tech vs. inflationary money.
Our credit-based monetary system can’t accept general price deflation without risking a debt cascade. So it must counteract technology’s price drops with more credit, more stimulus, and, eventually, more control. You can see the artifact: pre-2020 there was roughly ~$250T of debt supporting an ~$80T global economy, with ~$185T of that debt added in just the prior ~20 years. That’s the “smoking gun” showing technology’s deflation being overwhelmed by monetary inflation. Side effects: asset bubbles, wage stagnation (the other side of inflation), record inequality, social fracture, and regulatory capture as power centralizes.

4) We measure a system… by the system.
GDP and CPI are built for yesterday’s production logic. When goods become software and software tends to free, the metrics mislead. “When a measure becomes a metric, it ceases to be a good measure.” We then build policy atop warped dials, which worsens the underlying fragility. People argue about each snowflake while ignoring the unstable avalanche slope: the system design.

5) CBDCs are the system’s logical endgame.
If you must perpetually add stimulus and aim it precisely, the temptation is to remove intermediaries and centralize issuance and distribution—“surveillance disguised as money.” Without an alternative, that’s where the politics of pain lead: programmable, gate-kept currency to manage the fallout of a failing debt loop.

6) Why Bitcoin—not gold—maps to an exponential world.
Gold historically constrained rulers—until it had to be centralized and then was captured and repriced. Humans in the loop eventually bend rules. Bitcoin is the first monetary network that can remove us from the loop: decentralized validation, energy-bounded issuance, rules that don’t care who’s in office. It’s a research lab outside the legacy firm—like Apple’s iPhone skunkworks—where creative destruction can proceed without the incumbent’s antibodies. Measured in bitcoin, you see the free market’s truth: as adoption rises, prices of real-world goods fall in BTC terms toward utility value.

7) “But can it scale for payments?” (Yes—on layers.)
Base-layer proof-of-work optimizes for security and decentralization (≈10-minute settlement). Speed lives on Layer 2. The Lightning Network already enables instant, low-cost payments and anchors back to Layer 1 for finality. Two reinforcing network effects are emerging: store of value (Layer 1) and payments (Layer 2). We’re still early—think Internet 1998—when most value hadn’t yet migrated to second layers and applications.

8) Distribution of ownership and power.
Legacy logic says “wealth = power.” In Bitcoin, attempting to use wealth to control the network requires distributing coins (selling them) to others—eroding the would-be controller’s position. Nodes enforce rules, not institutions. That dynamics flips the usual equation and broadens participation over time.

9) Action beats outrage.
You can’t reform an inflation-dependent system from inside its logic. Move part of your life to the open network: get off zero, learn self-custody, run a node, use Lightning. Each migration step reduces your dependency on the control loop and strengthens the alternative. This is not about a price target; it’s about aligning with the system that lets deflation be shared rather than weaponized.








Interview #2
Finance Junkies — “BTC vs The Monetary System,” March 6, 2025

Theme: Why a credit-based system can’t allow deflation (and why your actions—not “they”—sustain it)

1) Technology’s deflation vs. money’s inflation—an irreconcilable clash.
From an entrepreneur’s lens, Jeff tracks how software relentlessly lowers marginal costs across logistics, energy, mining—everywhere (00:01–00:04). In a free market, those gains show up as falling prices. But in a credit system, falling prices make existing debt more expensive in real terms, triggering a cascade of defaults. That’s why policy must manufacture inflation. Translation: your lived experience of “things getting more expensive” is not natural—it’s the operating requirement of debt-money.

2) Debt is the money—so the system must grow or fail.
Jeff sketches the uncomfortable mechanics (00:07–00:08): banks create money as loans; if loans shrink, so does the money supply. “If everyone paid back their debts there would be no money.” That’s the Great Depression logic loop: when productivity should push prices down, authorities must counteract with more credit, regulation, and control to prevent a deflationary spiral. Hence the drumbeat of bailouts, QE, and “stimulus”—not moral failings so much as structural necessity.

3) Stop hunting for villains; change the game you’re playing.
A recurring theme (00:06–00:07, 00:09–00:11): there isn’t a monolithic “they.” Most of us reinforce the system by optimizing for more fiat, more yield, more asset appreciation—activities that demand ongoing debasement to appear “successful.” The fastest way to weaken coercive leverage is to redirect time and value creation into the open network: earn, save, build, and transact in Bitcoin.

4) Bitcoin as an energy-bounded truth protocol.
Jeff frames Bitcoin not as an “investment” but as measurement infrastructure (00:26–00:29). Because rules can’t be bent by politics and are enforced by nodes, it “measures the free market perfectly”—prices of houses, energy, goods trend down in bitcoin terms toward utility value. The only caveat: it must remain decentralized and secure. With self-custody, Bitcoin becomes “the only thing without counterparty risk.” That property flips the current pyramid: governments, banks, and corporate balance sheets all carry counterparty risk; bearer BTC in your keys does not.

5) Beware re-centralization traps (old habits in new wrappers).
Jeff flags the risk of importing fiat reflexes—ETF convenience, custodial “yield,” trusting brand names (00:48–00:50). Those paths can metastasize into “imperialism 2.0 on Bitcoin,” where IOUs and gatekeepers rebuild chokepoints. His antidote is practical: run a node, use self-custody, and transact peer-to-peer so that node consensus—not institutional preference—guards the rules.

6) Miners as an always-on buyer of stranded energy.
On mining economics (00:52–00:56), he explains why difficulty adjustment and capex/opex realities keep miners chasing the world’s cheapest energy and getting liquidated if they’re inefficient. The emergent effect is a global, real-time market for energy—with Bitcoin acting like a bakery’s guaranteed buyer of leftover bread: incentives push toward overbuilt capacity and falling energy prices in BTC terms.

7) Personal transition beats political salvation.
Expect a long, chaotic overlap (00:39–00:43). People anchored to fiat optics will suffer repeated shocks as narratives and numbers diverge. But individuals can flip the switch today: allocate more time to the honest ledger—earn in sats, DCA with auto-withdraw, spend over Lightning, show up on Nostr, build for users who want exit ramps. The reward is compounding purchasing power and participation in a truly global free market that unlocks talent far beyond today’s gated economies (01:01–01:04).

8) Purpose in a deflationary world.
No, people don’t get lazy when work decouples from survival (01:08–01:11). The market keeps rewarding problem-solvers who deliver more value for less. Under Bitcoin, productivity gains benefit everyone instead of being siphoned via debasement and regulatory moats. The result is more time, broader participation, and a culture shift from extraction to contribution.






Interview #3
Onramp Bitcoin — Sept 20, 2025

Theme: Two incompatible systems—and why builders win by opting out, not lobbying

1) Model vs. reality: the debt parabola.
Six years after The Price of Tomorrow, the mechanism is intact: technology delivers exponential deflation; a debt-based system must counter with exponential credit. Jeff cites ~$650T global debt today, with the world’s asset base (~$900T–$1Q) tethered to that liability. That’s why “no one will let the debt fall”—governments or voters. Expect more monetary manipulation, more centralization, more rule-changes to preserve the facade.

2) What Bitcoin actually measures.
Bitcoin isn’t “rising”; it’s a neutral yardstick showing prices falling in BTC terms toward utility value as productivity compounds. If—and only if—Bitcoin stays decentralized and secure, self-custodied BTC becomes the only asset without counterparty risk. Everything in the legacy stack carries it.

3) Builders in the open system beat bidders in the closed one.
Jeff contrasts fiat-VC “get big, then profit (maybe)” with Bitcoin-native companies that go seed → profitability, then raise—often adding BTC to the treasury monthly. Operating in BTC imposes a natural hurdle rate and capital discipline; you hire better, automate faster, and ship what people actually value. Ego Death portfolio pattern: zero blow-ups to date, multiple profit engines compounding without serial equity rounds.

4) Leverage and “digital-asset treasuries.”
Some corporate BTC strategies (levered balance sheets, crowded “yield” trades) will win for a time, then blow up in classic reflexive cycles—distributing coins from weak to strong hands. If the whole market looked like that, it would centralize Bitcoin; fortunately nodes enforce rules, and cheaters eventually get wiped out.

5) Nation-states: from kill → co-opt.
After failing to stop Bitcoin, states will try to own or wrap it. Stablecoins soak up global dollar demand (“guaranteed-loss coins” still beat collapsing locals), and gold accumulation signals defensive posture—but gold centralizes and can be repriced. Treat “reserve asset” talk cautiously: if capture attempts hard-fork the rules, you’d get US-coin vs. Bitcoin; the real network stays outside political discretion.

6) Commerce reality check: fees, margins, and Lightning.
Merchants pay 2.5–3% (US), 5–10% (many regions) to accept money that loses value. Lightning flips it: near-zero fees, final settlement into hard money. Rational businesses will discount for BTC receipts; adoption grows fastest where payment friction and currency decay are worst. Jeff’s own behavior: spend and replace—fund the world you want.

7) AI is gasoline on deflation.
Near-term: agent swarms eat the “95% coding” grunt work; next, robotics fuses digital deflation with the physical world. Net effect: labor displacement → prices should fall faster. Debt-money can’t allow that, so expect more control—CBDC-style programmability, policy shocks, and media fog (bots everywhere). Don’t feed fear loops; build in hope.

8) Personal agency beats Overton wins.
Most people still resolve paradox from inside fiat narratives. The migration is individual: hold BTC, self-custody, run a node, use Lightning, price in sats. Businesses should absolutely keep some BTC on balance sheet; families should get inheritance paths right now. The infinite game rewards those who create value while refusing to subsidize the zero-sum machine.
