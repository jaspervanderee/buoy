Bold Conjectures with Paras Chopra
Jeff Booth - Deflation is the key to creating a paradise
Aug 17, 2021

[Music] hi everyone uh welcome to bold conjectures with paris chopra today i am with jeff booth who's the author of the popular book the price of tomorrow where he analyzes the effects of technology-led deflation and monetary policy-led inflation he is also the founder of build direct a technology company that aimed to simplify the building industry for nearly two decades through the dot-com meltdown the 2008 financial crisis and many ways of technological disruption so jeff has seen ups and downs of technology and what effects technology can have so for his thoughts on technology economy and recently bitcoin jeff has been featured in many publications including forbes techcrunch and the wall street journal today i plan to discuss with jeff why so bullish on a world that's deflationary especially since all central banks prefer a modest amount of inflation in fact recently the time of recording we have i think u.s fed has also indicated again they uh they would keep the same monetary policy they've always had but jeff has a different point of view and that's what i'm very interested in exploring with jeff so jeff thank you so much for uh coming uh on this podcast today with me thanks for having me perez fantastic so jeff i wanted to first start with understanding a little bit about your background as a technology entrepreneur how did you come about thinking so deeply about economy and monetary policy especially how did you come about thinking about deflation um i would say i'm curious about a whole bunch of things right now i'm i'm i'm chairman of seven different boards um i read 50 books a year i'm i'm just curious and and so if you think about what entrepreneurs do um and what an entrepreneur tries to do in the business is is they try to design a business that makes things better for people ultimately they try to bring down prices or give more service more for less and technology entrepreneurs do the exact same thing and and so what you do by the structure that you're using to be able to do that essentially you're looking at something that's broken in the world and saying i can fix that thing with this technology or otherwise and i have a better way to do it so if you just think about that process or as you say what led me to this um i've been a technology entrepreneur all my life and built a bunch of technology companies and very successful uh technology companies and still do that today and for the last 10 years i couldn't understand why we we live in a world where technology is making things cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and um and giving us more for less it's all around us and and and i couldn't understand why that wasn't reducing prices everywhere and so um so instead of and so again i'm an entrepreneur first that is my thing the the the what got me down the rabbit hole or started getting me to look into economics and everything else was the fact that i realized the system was broken and you had two different forces you had a force of technology trying to give more for less to the world and you had a force of inflation just because it's always been the system we lived in that's trying to do the opposite that's trying to drive prices up and i realized that technology is actually a bigger force technology is going to win that fight but it's not going to it's going to be a fight the central banks are going to try to stop at all costs and we can explore why they need to stop it or why they're going to try to stop it at all costs but the your question about why did i write the book yeah how did i get into this is i got into it because um i have a young family and i worry i i worried about what their future would look like i i have a business in india i i i i and fantastic people there um and and and i i worry what people what the world will look like for four people on on this on this epic fight of our time that most people don't even understand is happening right so jeff you said uh that technology is making everything cheaper uh i i guess uh an average person would probably disagree uh on the surface of it they'd point to various things right from milk to houses everything has become more expensive so how would you respond to that perception that uh things are not becoming cheaper so so be because you're in a system and so let's i think first off because this is a really complicated topic and people don't go deep enough and so they and and they live in the system and assist that system is being manipulated to make prices go up and so they live in that system it's hard to see another system what that other system would look like so let's just explore some of these topics from first first principles first so what is inflation um inflation is when a simple definition is when your money is worth less overtime so goods and services get more expensive over time um and that sounds like why would we want that yeah right like personally i don't want my money to be worth less over time and i don't want goods and services to be worth more over time but but again that's all it is it's it's and what's deflation it's the opposite your money is worth more over to uh time goods and services cost less over time so for forget for a moment all of your biases on which one you want and just look at the facts that's what that's what each of those are now now ask on top of that question who wins and who loses in each system so on a on inflation [Music] if you have more assets if you have more wealth like i do um then those assets go up as a result and the real cost of the debt goes down so i pay back the debt with cheaper dollars tomorrow so so i win people like me when people with lots of money win in inflate and inflation and who loses in inflation your savings and wages go down so your real-time income is actually going your real wages are going down against that force it's just the opposite side of that coin so who loses from that economic calculation people with with savings people with uh uh people with incomes that don't have the assets they they lose out of that calculation now on the other um and so now now why inflation why do we believe that we need inflation because it doesn't seem logical right that we would build a society around around inflation and and what inflation is really for governments it's a hidden tax so that it's it what it really is is it's a theft giving giving taking from the poor and giving to the rich but doing it in a way because because people because people don't see that it's a hidden tax they will they will take governments will say it will spend more than they can they can pay for and they'll hide that tax and inflation and and and so it's a really bad tax so that's so it actually hurts the people then a lot of people think governments should spend more and more and more and drive inflation and actually the most the people hurt most by it are the lower middle and lower class because it's taking taking from them but that's actually why why that exists because government can increase their power through a hidden tax right yeah so yeah go ahead go ahead yeah i was i was just trying to capture what you've said uh in my understanding so you're saying inflation is where the purchasing power becomes less over time and people with assets they grow richer but people with liquid money they become poorer in comparison and that's what the inflation does this transfer of purchasing power from the poor to the building exactly the middle class and poor to the wealthy and so so and again why we didn't see that humanity didn't see it generally by the way india's india has been really hurt by it in other countries u.s has been helped by it because they run the currency around the world and people begged for your currency so uh and other countries are hurt by it so the same thing that's happening inside a country inside the u.s for rich and poor is actually happening outside the u.s for a whole bunch of other countries that use the u.s reserve uh system how sorry how exactly i did not follow that because because because because if you're essentially if you're using the us reserve because as your currency and they're printing that money and it's just making up new money just it's not real money it's just i'm gonna make up numbers to drive inflation then somebody has to be hurt by that economic calculation and there's a whole bunch of countries just like kind of rich and poor in inside the country there's a whole bunch of countries that are on the losing side of that economic equation right and and so so but we why we didn't see that and why we didn't see it is because technology wasn't moving as fast as it is today and so so technology we measure inflation you probably a lot of people that are on your show because they've never asked these questions to they're listening to your show they've never asked these questions to themselves we get caught in the trap and we don't question our beliefs very often so we hear two percent inflation and okay that's good because it's always been good and our houses rise as a result of that and somebody else is losing out of that but we think okay that's great i'm going to leave her up i'm going to buy more houses or i'm going to and if you're rich that works really well for you and if you're not it works really poor uh poorly for you but why we don't question that is we think the base is zero and two percent if somebody stole really what it is is theft if somebody stole two percent from you per year you might not notice it but that's really what it is um but the base isn't zero because technology is moving the other way faster so if you take 30 years ago you probably had disinflation about a negative like one percent disinflation and so what governments did and and policy makers did is they drove down interest rates and down interest rates down interest rates over and over and over to try to grow out of technology trying to give you more for less so they tried to and and what that did and then and then there was in the last 20 years before covet again this is important because it's exploded since covet but in the last 20 years sorry first to run the global economy there's 250 trillion dollars of debt for an 80 trillion dollar global economy if you if you tried to pay back a trillion dollars at one dollar a second it would take 31 700 years 710 years so so these are enormous numbers and that not those numbers can never be paid back so they're mounted out but but here's the smoking gun and on if kind of my thesis said technology is exponentially deflationary it's moving this way so fast it's trying to give us more for less on an exponential pattern then debt must be compounding just as fast on the other side to be able to hide that from society so when i when you break down the 250 trillion dollar for uh for an 80 trillion dollar global economy what you find is in the last 20 years exactly what what you would project projective technology was doing more in the last 20 years there has been 185 trillion dollars of that 250 trillion added right right so so when you when you when when you say when you ask so so 185 trillion in the last 20 years globally to produce 46 trillion dollars of economic growth in gdp so four dollars of debt for every one dollar of growth by the way it's way worse now it's getting worse and worse and worse as it has to get worse and worse and so so what ends up happening is everybody knows that debt can't be paid back so so the debt isn't being paid back it what's happening is the governments are changing the rules and printing money to pretend it can be paid back and so what's happening is they're actually devaluing your the currency and what people think is prices going up is prices going uh relative prices going up against a devalued currency so you'd have to ask yourself this um would house prices go up and over the last 20 years if there wasn't 185 trillion dollars of stimulus globally and simply the answer is no there's no chance the house price is going to go up when food prices go up with all of these prices that you you believe are going up because the currency value is going down would they if there wasn't manipulation in the currency right and and the prices going up say for houses wouldn't be a problem if people could afford it if people's wages would have risen accordingly but but it hasn't and that's the economic calculation the economic calculation why inflation is a theft is if wages went up as fast then it wouldn't help governments and you couldn't get rid of the debt so inflation is wage deflation it's just opposite sides of the same coin yeah right yeah so and so that's the point so what people what what what's happening is people are on a mouse wheel and they're running faster and faster and faster work sometimes working two three jobs trying to get ahead of of inflate man-made inflation by manipulating currency trying to get out of the out of this trap running harder and harder and harder and it's moving further and further away from them because the real wages are going down right so i'm trying to uh make sure i understand the debt argument right are you are you saying governments uh [Music] pursue monetary inflation so that they have less to pay back if if they're reasonable that's the primary motivation exactly so so so now if you have an entire economy now now think of a globally econ economy now remember i don't make the rules technology is it's a fact is deflationary it provides more efficiency it that means and that efficiency provides a better value and prices go down that is that's a fact and it's a harsh fact so look at how many photos you use today versus the photos you used before look at um look at music today you can buy music for 9.95 for is it unlimited music where i used to buy 19.95 for every cd um so when you digitize things and they they and it creates abundance and things move to free that's what every entrepreneur is doing that's what i do and everything else so you're trying to give the world more for less and and and we we we mistake this and it's really important we mistake it we mistake because we don't understand economics people don't look deep enough to economics they trust other people to say oh that's the way the system works it's yeah that's what um and they don't ask the next question in economics gets people talk about monetary policy or um quantitative easing and if they actually said the truth on what it is i'm going to steal more from you so you don't see it you might look deeper but but it sounds like it oh it's oh that must be okay right it sounds like um so so you don't you don't look so so again technology has changed the rules prices should be at it falling at an ever increasing rate and we think about economics as um as uh it is value everybody thinks of economics is about value and economics is not about value at all economics is about scarcity either real or perceived so if you can convince somebody if de beers can can lock up diamond supply even though there's tons of diamonds and convince people that their husband only loves them if they buy a really expensive diamond ring through advertising then they can take something that's really abundant in the world and create scarcity um and charge a lot for those diamonds brands can do the same thing um but but what it and so so so can i uh i'll give you an example here [Music] the most valuable thing in your your life today the most valuable is the area you're breathing right now why don't you pay for it yeah because it's abundant um it's all around you and it's abundant the only place you pay for it is uh if you're in a hospital with covid um or uh um or underwater where it's scarce and and and so so economics is not about value economics is about scarcity either real or perceived and so you what you have in the world today is technology wanting to create more for less create abundance and if you run an economic policy where you have abundant money [Music] more and more money that means everything else is scarce right or if you had fixed money everything else is abundant that's what's and and and that's what's happening today and so governments because they've run policies and and and and they're trapped right now yeah because because they're they're so levered with so much debt that if they let deflation happen today then then that so the debt would get more expensive and it would get more and more and more expensive and they couldn't pay it back so so governments are trying to outrun that problem which they can't outrun yeah i mean it seems a catch-22 sort of a situation wherein the only reason governments are pursuing inflation is because they've pursued inflation so i was wondering if uh magically we can reset the world today from ground zero where the debt was zero or government debt was zero would it make sense for governments to pursue deflation because there's no debt so so you have to you have to ask yourself where does control come from and control comes from it you can it's easy to convince a whole bunch of people that you're doing work for you you're doing you're helping them by giving them more money today that you can pay for it's easier to do that job than say hey we have to tax you the actual rate to pay for services it's it's easier to hide in inflation and tell people you can give them more for less or more more than you can and then pick their pocket and so um so so could um could governments change that unfortunately um i don't believe so um i i did when i wrote the book i was trying to find any way possible that we could have actually a first principles conversation on this important topic for humanity this is it it's the biggest topic in humanity by the way um climate change is a result of inflation so yeah monetary policy drive you can't fix climate through a policy that has to make prices go up forever it makes sense right because innovation is driving prices down so if you looked at solar wind everything else even ener all energy prices are coming down [Music] and everything else is coming down so the only way to offset that green clean energy is actually to print more money to make prices go up more so every count every effect that you're driving prices down innovation on one side they're two totally different systems you have to counter act with more printing to make prices go up and people are so confused because we're going through a system change but and then they say well well the climate's getting really red climate change is a really big issue but but the pro the climate being a big issue is monetary policy is climate change and and but people don't ask these questions because they're measuring a system from the system right but isn't something like climate change really driven by consumption uh i i don't think i fully understood the connection how okay inspiration is connected to that so and and that's what that's why it's hard it'd be hard for you to see too but let's just say so what should happen what is happening so what should happening is energy prices should be trending not to zero but they should be trending on a line they're getting 11 cheaper per year on solar and it's taking up more and more of the grid yeah i agree so and so so energy as one thing not robotics not artificial intelligence not everything else that are also all deflationary but energy is one thing that is powering every other industry is getting cheaper by 11 per year and so every other industry is built on top of energy so if that's getting cheaper [Music] but and but you can't you're not your energy isn't getting cheaper your gas prices are going up so you have to spend more time driving to work or to not right now in covet but you have to spend more time racing on a make-believe system to try to and everybody does trying to chase prices up more consumption more more more shipping more consumption more everything more work when the work actually isn't even needed right the work is only needed the work is only needed to support the prices that are artificially made anyways to support the work to pretend where we live in that system so the entire system that nobody sees there they are they are little cogs in the wheel of this system not realizing actually they've become slaves to a system right that requires good because it it just and it it's sometimes easier if you just looked at yourself just one person again inflation deflation in your own life you you want more for less yeah don't you think your neighbor does too yeah you think his neighbor does too don't think her neighbor does too we want more for less why do we believe in a system that has to go the other way so if you want more for less and every year you were getting more for less would you need to work as hard right yeah no i mean you wouldn't i mean we want everything for the least amount of effort exactly so you're tired what technology does is it saves your time yeah that's why you use it that's why every ceo puts it in ceos don't put in technologies in their companies to make prices go up and and make their make their business uncompetitive they you use it to save your time that's the point so if you run a system that is opposite to that natural system um all hell breaks loose and and climate change again inflation equals climate change there is no way to grow forever so inflation the existing system has to grow forever on a finite planet yeah and we'll manipulate money to do so and and and so the opposite system even if we can't see it is actually what the truth is but most people can't make the bridge because they're so stuck into a system and they believe all the media and the hype of everything else about a system that has to make prices go up forever yeah i agree i mean technology's tendency especially when combined with entrepreneurship is to make things cheaper so it does seem a little odd that a lot of things are becoming more expensive or what you're saying is it's because the system is biased against uh against the average person enjoying the fruit of technology exactly and the more you do that so so imagine 30 years ago you had a little lie or a little theft that that and now it was one percent it should have been one percent negative and uh the iridescence inflation so things would be getting a little cheaper and then as more technology is entering and it is moving exponentially it should be getting a lot cheaper and maybe it's maybe maybe the measuring right now is negative five percent that's what it should be the real rate but inflation is now running at five percent so you actually don't have a two percent theft per year you have a ten percent theft per year and so so when you corrupt money itself when you essentially if here's a better way of looking at it money is just information nobody wants more money they want what they believe that money will be able to buy them or that or the safety for their family or anything else the money is an arbitrary construct it's just information yeah so when you corrupt information when information is is bad just like in a technology program if you have corruption in your code you have corruption everywhere when you corrupt when you when when you corrupt information then it's quite likely you have corruption everywhere as a result and so when you when you look at a whole bunch of conspiracy theories and and everything else and what it feels like is the world is getting more dangerous people are getting um that is actually all a second-order derivative of corruption of money right so on on this topic playing uh i mean playing the devil's advocate for a second uh i think some people will argue government's ability to print money is beneficial because it can give money directly to the poor just like it did in covert where it's called helicopter money but in a deflationary environment that's not possible the government is sort of helpless too and it wouldn't it amplify the rich becoming richer oh no no the complete opposite that but that's actually so so that's what you're led to believe right so if you just said who does inflation help we've already talked about this right right as inflation help so so so when you take that economic calculation and you say so so then what governments would do to make those programs expand the government power bear to be able to to essentially steal faster so to give you money to pre and take it out of the other pocket faster but but because people are so confused on on that inflation is wage deflation they don't know it and they're they're victims of a system and and they don't know it just like your question actually is a perfect question because you don't know because you actually believe that that system is helping people and it's in the people that it's hurt the people that it's that it's hurting the most think it's actually helping them because they become victims of a system that is completely unfair and it's again it's unfair because uh people become dependent on government for such grants so so government doesn't create doesn't the government doesn't create jobs the free market creates jobs um government taxes to be able to to to redistribute so if they hide their tax in inflation instead of telling you the truth on tax then then that that that that is that's really a theft of economy so as as government gets bigger the free market has to get smaller and look at any centrally planned uh economy over a long time look at russia look at anything else what ends up happening is as government gets bigger and bigger and bigger they have to get bigger at the expense of the free market and because free markets are are more competitive than than centrally planned economies because of all they could centrally plan economies have to choose all of the market signals by a couple of people and so free markets are more competitive and if they're more competitive they can give more wealth to their citizens so if a government gets bigger and bigger and bigger essentially what ends up happening is eventually it's controlled by the biggest threat [Music] it has to be it's just more and more central planning taking away more and more of the free market in canada right now um 26 of the entire economy is government spending okay and and and um and and as that gets bigger and bigger and it has to get bigger so naturally there's natural tendency to become bigger but but again because they're hiding inflation in this number and they're printing all this money to be able to get bigger and more and more different rules come in and and and what would it what would a an entrepreneur in a free market do in that case because prices are going up wouldn't they add technology to their business faster [Music] to try to reduce the price because prices are going up seems obvious right right so they would get rid of jobs faster which would cause the government to say it's their fault it's a free market's fault and then and print more money to be able to get bigger faster to be able to take away more of the free market right so so so those so we we're living in a pattern right now where things are moving to be centralized faster and faster and faster because people actually believe that that's a good thing but it's a terrible thing unless you unless you believe that the person in control the the one or two people that are in control will always be on the lookout for all people then you've given your freedom away that's what that that's that that's what's happening and and then i question then i look at these types of things why in russia or or in myanmar why doesn't everybody stand up um and and it's actually the derivative of the same thing we just talked about um not everyone will stand up because a lot of people think that the government is they're safe in that environment even if they losing their freight freedoms and everything else they think they're either enriched by it they're close to government or they're uh or they're protected by it and so not enough people will stand up and and so what ends up happening is typically the the government also typically at that time controls the media and everything else the the the few people that if you looked at navalny in russia today the few people that will stand up will uh will be uh will be taken out that's what that's what those that's what a society would look like in that type of environment now now ask yourself this that's today where we're going in the next 10 years with technology we'll have it we'll have artificial intelligence and robotics in a way different way than we have today can you imagine that concentration of power with artificial intelligence and robotics and and and the cameras everywhere no one's going to stand up yeah so so we how big again into my book and everything else how big a deal this is for humanity um is a really big deal if we don't if if um it's one of the reasons that i've that i think bitcoin is one of the most important innovations um on the planet today the most important because because it allows you to transition governments won't they they can't they they can't stop this pattern right now because it's assist and it's not bad people typically it's a system that'll keep feeding back in a belief system that'll keep feeding back on itself and and i think bitcoin is is no it kodak never changed themselves blockbuster never changed themselves to netflix businesses typically do the opposite of what technology requires and and they get disrupted by technology companies and creating better better outcomes for people that's typically what happens all that's happened by governments stopping that action stopping the free market from working and price is coming down what's happened is that creative destruction has moved from the economy level to the currency level and so what would you expect so if you looked at kodak um and and what how they run their business for almost 100 years um um versus we use more photos today and kodak actually created the digital camera yeah they invented it why didn't they see it and again it was against their existing structure to see it because the digital camera made photos for free it made photos free and their business came from something else so using those lenses on what's normal in a business would be normal in a government because business is just a collection of people a government is just a collection of people and we we we assign malice we assign these people know more than than they they don't it's just a system reinforcing on itself and that system must continue to drive more and more centralization and power at this point because and and you asked a question a long time ago a while ago that said can we reset it the answer is no without a without revolution and war and the if you look through history these the resets of currencies are always done through revolution and war right how much so um thinking about government from first principles i mean it's a collection of i mean it's people taking care of each other in a very indirect way as a society we nominate a certain people who take care of the rest of the folks i mean i think everyone would agree a completely centralized system is not good it is centralization of power but are you suggesting a complete uh entirely free market kind of structure is a better way or something of a compromise in between so so the most important thing that i like karen why do i away and a kind of a new system like bitcoin could allow this to happen is all all it does is moves the inflation or the fraud above the line so you can just imagine if every government was on bitcoin or if the indian government was on on bitcoin what they would have to do in a competitive market against other countries is is say here's what we're going to tax people and and government's going to get smaller but this is why we're going to tax we're going to tax people this because we want to provide these services for the other people the only difference in the two systems are one is based on a truth and one is based on a lie the only difference right so and so so what would happen is and i can tell you from my myself i i don't want to live in if i had all the wealth and i walked out my door and 99 of people are in abject poverty i don't want to live in that society so i can so i can tell you the type of type of government speaking truth who i'd vote for because i would want to make sure that there was a transition i would want so so so mostly free market um and and but in a way that was based on truth right so and i mean i agree uh in within inflation it's easy to squeeze in inefficiencies governments inefficiency typically get squeezed in that's why they have to uh inflate away that but something like uh bitcoin which you cannot inflate would naturally be a forcing function for better efficiency and that's where government would have to strip down to its minimal bare minimum functions totally and so so what would happen is is it what would happen is and again going to first principles i think you would agree technology is deflationary yeah you agree with that then you must agree with this anything that is inflationary any currency that is inflationary against that force steals power from the people and centralizes government as a byproduct is that true okay anything that uh anything that is inflationary against against a deflationary force as powerful as technology only is so by concentrating power um i would say it's a it would be a consequence of concentration of power right only someone in power can do that yeah but i mean if you created essentially if you created money out of nothing to drive inflation against the natural force it's the natural force of entrepreneurs trying to drive prices down to free like your oxygen that's what would happen that's what would happen then anything stopping that force has to be a concentration of power right fair has to be yeah so so so so today and again i i don't say this because like if the world could just keep going i wouldn't have written a book but but today what that means is technology where we're going for humanity requires it requires a currency that is both digitally native and that will allow for deflation it has to because what that means is you have a technology that that empowers human beings it gives the broadest process possible distribution of wealth by that fact the broadest possible and and and and so anything that stops that concentrates wealth and power yeah sometimes some sometimes in the name of i'm doing it to protect i'm doing it to help other people exactly i'm doing it to protect other people but it doesn't change that it doesn't change the fact that it that it doesn't protect other people it hurts them yeah i mean if there is a central entity like a government or a central bank and if they decide how much new currency has to be in existence and who gets that i think i agree they are just concentrating their power we're just giving more and more power to them to decide our future okay and and and then have you ever heard the the quote from lord axe and um power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely yeah and and that's what that's what happens because and people change their mind right some sometimes a great leader becomes an egomaniac or or gets sick and changes their mind and everything changes so if you concentrate power in a human being um with with how we think we can change our minds right and i wish that wasn't true i wish that wasn't true but it is true throughout throughout history and so so if so if you if you take code or if you take bitcoin specifically and removes that power from humans forever [Music] and and and essentially aligns the laws of nature 100 technology and nature what ends up happening is you have the broadest abundance yeah yeah but coming back to the point i was making uh i agree concentration of power is natural uh but we're not concentrating a power in a person there right we're concentrating power in a system which uh we'd call like a democracy and i know democracy has uh in many manifestations but as an idealized system uh if i mean i i really want to think from it from an ideal point of view and not an implementation point of view what's wrong with concentrating power in a democracy because a democracy based on a lie is not a democracy what ends up happening if you're concentrating that much wealth and power then the people with wealth and power are the democracy everybody else thinks they are but they're not that's the the russia has a democracy it doesn't it's not it doesn't look like a democracy the only people that can get elected are the people that are putting it put into and and the people that are closest to the power um how much do you think microsoft or amazon or google spend on lobbying last year you don't have a chance in that democracy you don't have a chance because the elected leaders get paid a whole bunch more by the by the lobbyists and everything else in the the um and and who has the money to be able to do it so if you concentrate wealth and power out of this it is not a democracy anymore right yeah i mean uh i think there is like a lack for a better naive faith that western countries especially usa and even canada and other countries will not uh become corrupt in the same way other nations have so here's the thing i wish that was true too but but but again if if you're if your power comes from a lie and that lie must expand because technology is going one way and your system is going the other way so it has to steal more it has to if that if that is is based on a lie then democracy fails to i in and th these are these are super important concepts uh for us that very few people talk about at this depth um and and and trust me i grew up in this world and i've been a beneficiary of of a stable market um laws and orders i've been a beneficiary of inflation i've created lots of successful companies and everything else so i'm one of the winners out of this system and by the way more and more what it was the the um in the last 18 months the the the world's richest 500 people 500 people not a thousand not 2 000 not 10 thousand five hundred people have increased their wealth by by forty percent to eight point four trillion dollars yeah that's what's insane it's insane in covet in a time of code so so what you did to help all of those other people because you transferred a whole bunch of wealth to the richest 500 people who do who do you think is more influential on making the laws and so so i wish what i just said wasn't true i really do i would um for me to to understand this at the first principles and let right through through it all i had to face a whole bunch of things that i believed true and that were responsible for a whole bunch of my wealth and gains and everything else but then i realized that that then when you realize that you realize some of that comes from the expense of other people and i could either say oh that's okay or do something about it so i did something about it with by writing the by writing the book and and and and what i care about is truth in a fair system that's what that that's what i care about i care about it for us i care about true democracy i care about i i and and i think on something like i think on something like a bitcoin standard you would get true democracy right so jeff we are in 2021 and uh these topics like you said they are not very easy to comprehend i mean these take some second order third order consequences to digest and uh really make sense of these things uh given that it is difficult for everyone to grasp these intuitively how do you expect things to play from here in future i know future prediction is difficult but what's the default uh unfolding of the world do you expect from here on and how can we collectively shift it to be a better world for everyone so this is happening really fast on both remember two different systems two different systems with feedback effects moving opposite directions um and so the system we're in is going to get a lot worse and more signposts and more you'll see signposts everywhere more more what ends up happening in that type of system is governments have to create an enemy first first typically inside a country then outside of a country to retain power they have to they have to turn society on itself to be able to to retain power you are going to see that all over the world faster and faster and faster on our existing system um because it's not it has to be i wish that again nick wish that wasn't true but that's what you're going to see that that path it's unstable it's creating more and more instability that's why these are normally fixed through revolution and war and a reset of all currencies with the winner take winner take all consent with the winners saying with what the game board looks like for everybody else but wars won't be fought like they were fought wars with wars today with with ai and automate and drones and and automation everything else would look very very different um but that is where kind of that path takes us the ex exact opposite path is freedom and um and abundance um i'm really hopeful for the exact opposite path um but it is not a guarantee that's actually why that's why i've become actually a bitcoin advocate because because i actually think it's the best chance for humanity to make a transition system changes are hard yeah the system has changes are really hard so the more people that start to investigate bitcoin and what it means for them where where nobody can take your um and nobody can take your money if they can't take your memory they can't take your money and if you understand that deep enough it's really important i don't care about the wealthy getting bitcoin i care about individuals i'm starting to understand bitcoin put in ten dollars a week put in fifty dollars a week put in whatever but start to make a difference because because that that essentially is a system that that benefits humanity in general but any every single person that's doing that will understand way more just kind of learning about it they'll understand way more of what we're talking about right uh but governments will do whatever they can to make sure they don't let go of power but but again what ends up happening too and you saw el salvador el salvador kind of creating uh going to bitcoin yeah right and and you can see india right now is starting to talk about bitcoin what ends up happening is um the earlier the governments actually start to to explore this the more leverage they have because they're they're again why would somebody stop that so essentially what you're saying is i'm stopping it to retain control instead of instead of enable my people to be able to uh to to enjoy wealth and everything else so i'm stopping it for control so what um so you're right a lot of governments will try to stop it you'll hear a lot of news media and every everything else but the the game theory of bitcoin means that the people that go first enjoy more of an advantage so countries that go first and start to get on board faster yeah in in the week after el salvador um yeah announced that they were going uh they were turning bitcoin into a currency there um they had um a 5 000 increase in in searches from around the world for el salvador real estate they had an enormous i'm going to go there um and not to not to live there right now but i'm i may look at a business there um they had an enormous of entrepreneurs thinking about a free market um there where you had where you had poverty where you had um and and a lot of people think that poverty or sorry that crime like el salvador had a really high crime rate before people don't whether where that comes from it's poverty that creates crime not the other way around and so so when you when you give your citizens more power and more ability to create wealth for themselves then you stop crime they don't have to turn to they don't have to turn to drugs or anything else to feed their families they they they i think that's where i think that's the natural place of humanity where they want to do good but if you're in a system that can't totally can't allow that then then you turn you you turn to crime but just as a result it just if you looked at what was happening it's happening on el salvador countries that go first that's what's going to happen they'll have a race of talent they'll be comp they'll have a race of talent racing there for a free market that is in line with individual rights and freedoms right and so they'll benefit they'll have a larger benefit just like just like the people that um were early in bitcoin had a larger benefit than if you got into bitcoin today just like the countries that are starting to get into bitcoin now have a larger benefit to countries that get in later so is the same thing so as one system breaks down there becomes increasing benefit to go first into the other system that's true yeah it's uh i think the next uh i mean this decade her next decade is going to be super interesting to see because like you said this is technology and inflation to opposite forces uh making the existing system more and more unstable and uh and we do have uh according to a viable alternative uh hopefully we we build build a much more beautiful system around the new one this time than what we have right now i hope so i i hope so there's uh and again this is this these are really deep topics and everything else and i i think one of the things that scares people about the other system and they can't see and they can't see it so you're trapped in a system that's provide producing more and more negative effects all the time and i think a lot of people can see that but they but they get scared of letting go of that system and moving to a different system because of the fear of the unknown they don't know what that one looks like yeah right and so if there's no i'm going from here to here then it's really hard for people to to understand but and i i'm going to do some more work on where we're going to be able to paint the picture but where we're going on that new system is truly abundant it's um it looks uh i'll give you an example now in this this example might not be as strong in in india as it is here today but it will be in time information today is free is that fair yeah um and that means i can learn anything on any topic at any time and i can get best education on the planet for free is that true too yeah so so education is already free the best education is already free yeah certification is not free yeah but but what's happening is the best businesses are hiring the best talent and some of that talent um never had never got a secondary degree because they're they're educating themselves all the time and i can tell you from hiring thousands and thousands of people i i always hire the person that's most curious and and the the person that cares about uh learning all the time because they always are better in the in in the business so i don't care about it in education like um and and lots of other businesses when they're seeing kind of that success they're marrying that so what's happening is edu the entire education structure that right now is getting more and more expensive because the monetary policy and the only the only the people that have access to the most money can get into that system that feeds back on itself and a whole bunch of people fall below the line the people who low line right now but so we live in that system because we have a belief set based on when i grew up that you'd get a better job with the best education but that whole that whole belief set is going to in the next 10 years collapse on itself education's our education's already free and we just don't know it we just don't know it yet um we we couldn't have done this for us in uh um in a globally connected world and 10 years ago we couldn't have done this so that that that message is spreading around the world in an instant and it's and it's free yeah um so so if you have a system that allows that to happen then then then our time is saved as a result what the world looks like in that type of system is really i'm not again this isn't a utopia question or dystopia question um but but it certainly looks a lot better than what it looks like today in a system that allows for the technology to be broadly the technology the impact of technology to be broadly distributed yeah so jeff i i do have one question which is around uh how does this new system take care of the problems of the commons which is say for example things like pollution where i get the benefit but someone else pays its cost so one role of supposedly one role of government is to prevent that although then seldom effective there at least in india but uh if we get rid of that uh how how how does this work so i believe right now that and i understand the argument going way back in time kind of um i believe right now moving into a digital future where more and more things are being digitized and moving to free that but the that that most of that work would be solved better in the free market because if if a company if a company did that had and they had negative externalities and lots of jobs were falling out of the market and prices were getting cheaper all the time and that company kept margins high where do you think entrepreneurs would attack a business they would it would be a swarm of of hornets attacking that business from all sides to deliver better value because because there's a because the technology would enable anybody to attack that business so so so that um that's what i think that's what's happening today um it whereas in in a previous world that we're talking about is if you if you if if you had enough money in control you could block everybody out right and but that that doesn't the same game doesn't work in a technology-enabled world right my first my first company it took uh took over five million dollars um and uh um and i think 50 50 developers and everything else to build um the first version of our technology platform that um that today is literally free way better than that version three right way better like a hundred times better than that version and it's free i can just plug into it on the on on on the cloud um so so how do you how do you with a whole bunch of money in control how do you stop you stop your business being attacked you only stop your business from being attacked by giving more value to people yeah uh fantastic so jeff this has been uh really wonderful conversation uh enjoyed a lot uh learned a lot and uh recommend everyone to take a look at your book i will put that link in the interview notes and once again thank you so much for taking time out for talking with me no problem lots of fun thanks thank you bye jeff take care okay see ya
