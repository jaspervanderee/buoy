00:00:00	welcome to a special edition of Finance junkies I'm here with hindy kenup and our guest today is Jeff boot thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today no problem great to be here thanks thanks again Jeff thank you um we're humbly um we're humbled that you're you're joining us today um just for for us to start just to get to know a little bit about yourself in your own words um you know you talk about you know your your your failure successes with your with how you built your companies and if you can just tell us a

00:00:34	little bit about that and how and segue pretty much into when did you start seeing problems within the system that you that you you know constantly criticize yeah and and I don't know how your audience how much they know my work or not and I know you obviously do uh hindy um so maybe I'll start from a from kind of a path to kind of what led me to my the work I do today and so I've always been an entrepreneur what does an entrepreneur do primarily sees a problem tries to create value um by solving that

00:01:11	problem and so so that first um that that first idea uh I was a home builder I was a I was in real estate but the first real idea in uh using technology was using uh technology to solve the the supply chain and building supplies so I was early on the internet understood what was what the internet was going to be and allow you to do and I created a company that at one time was worth half a billion dollars and solving that because it was solving that problem um through the course of solving that problem um or trying to solve that

00:01:47	problem what what you realize as an entrepreneur is you're up against everything you're up against the status quo of what everybody does today you're up against a belief set of your version of the the future and creating that version of the future to provide value you're up against all of the mistakes you make along that that uh that road make a ton of them and you especially the first time you you do it you just don't know so you're trying things to provide value and mostly you're failing failing failing failing and you either

00:02:21	get get up knock your brush yourself or you stay knocked down and so I would keep getting up learn uh learning on all these things um that led me to a uh position kind of through the through the process of building that company through a whole bunch of waves of Technology Innovation and and Market collapses and everything else you could imagine um led me to a spot where I realized why is all the technology we're using every single entrepreneur is using technology to provide more value and unless they provide more value the

00:03:00	company goes broke so why wouldn't the output of that be deflation that more value prices would fall naturally everywhere so that was a problem I was talking about for about 10 years even before I wrote my book um if you were sitting around the campfire with me you didn't want to sit around the campfire with me because because it was all I was talking about it was um because I was the first technology we created a logistics technology literally cost about $5 million in 3 years tons of programmers to develop seven

00:03:33	years later it was free um and so but I realized that technology wasn't just in e-commerce companies or Google or Facebook or anything else or YouTube or what the the thing we're on right now it was also in energy distribution um and production it was also in mining it was everywhere so why weren't prices falling at that rate all over the over the place and so that's what led me to write my book the price of tomorrow why deflation is key to an abundant future because as I went down to the sand on this on the existing

00:04:09	system that we lived in and we're making stronger through our actions I realized the hypocrisy of that system the natural state of the free market is deflationary and should mean every single person is getting richer even every year even if they didn't work um and that and I knew that that would move exponentially faster as technology did more of our work and so it would bean it would mean from that system the world would live in abund would live in abundance as we as we move to there but the existing credit

00:04:43	based system couldn't allow that cred that that to allow prices to fall so the existing credit based system had to because because credit based system can't allow deflation so the credit based system that we lived in and made stronger through our actions by trying to make more money within it was going to rip apart Society because because we wouldn't allow that transition so that's that's what I explored in in the book and why I why I became very fascinated in Bitcoin and then and then SP and spending the

00:05:17	majority of my time in Bitcoin is because it it provided a resolve to that conflict that I just laid out where where a system problem couldn't couldn't solve what I'm talking about you couldn't you couldn't measure the system problem from the system you couldn't fix the system problem from the system that had to keep to basing currency but most people inside that system would think they could and make it stronger through their actions and then Bitcoin was something that was outside of that system imposing new a a

00:05:47	new system whether you cared about it or not so that's where uh that's where I I I got to am now and what's happening in Bitcoin we can explore any of these pieces because because I really understand to the sound like all the way down why the system looks the way it does why we make it stronger why why why this whole thing would be really chaotic and confusing for most people to to realize what we're going through I I have a question just to touch on something that you said you said that there are um actors within the system

00:06:20	that believe that they can sort of control the system and Usher Usher this in do you believe that the people the powers that be central banks the FED do they really believe that they can Usher in that they can um Rectify what you're saying with deflation and also a credit based system do they really believe that it's a that there's a solution within the system or are they just saying that to accumulate all of the wealth and basically rug pull the rest of us so Carlos I would ask yourself a question

00:06:48	instead of uh in these get really deep right really deep really fast and this is why this is why um how much time do you try to make money in that system versus being in on bitcoin what do you mean how much time how much time do you think about I need to make more dollars or all the time a single most front of mine thing that so in other words there is no they it's you because the minute that you move your time to bitcoin you defund to the system and you make Bitcoin stronger and while you while you

00:07:20	stay in trying to make more money from that system it just and it's and and I don't think there is any they I think it's our actions we wouldn't let a credit based system cannot allow deflation and why it can't allow deflation is you have the Great Depression but you'd have the Great Depression on steroids as everything collapses because because the money is Lent into existence so so imagine if money was lent into existence the bank actually creates more monetary units when they lend you money if everybody

00:07:51	paid back their debt there'd be no money but then be but since every dollar is created with a debt attached to it if everyone paid back all their debts there would be no money to pay back the debt that's what I mean there would be no money there' be no money there' be no the entire thing every single thing that you think is of value would be no zero it would all fail the your bank your bank would fail all of your the stores that you shop in would fail all of the the the government would fail everything

00:08:20	would fail as humans went back to a barter type of system and and and um and and it that would be a really bad day oh yeah yeah so you um and and so so you won't let that system fail so if a if a government comes think about what's happening with Dodge right now we rip we we we rip out a whole bunch of of this cost but that cost 25% of the government spending is the same GDP so you rip out the cost now you you you actually force a deflationary spiral which you have to you have to inflate with more printing

00:08:57	money so so there's going to be a people are going to be blown away if they believe in in in the new regime's control system um and they think it's so much better than the old regimes control system and they watch why is debt still going up higher so you think even with the efficiencies of Doge we're still going to see the debt increasing it has to not not not it might it has to or you have a complete wipe out of all the credit based system so so so the only thing that's happening today by the way I would I would far

00:09:35	more lean towards conservative I would far more so um than than the other control system but but they're both Control Systems really really what all you've done is move globalist and replac it with technocrats and everybody's cheering for one of those sides right um under I'm going to I'm going to go back to something first principles it and you should say this over and over say this before you go to sleep the natural state of the free market is deflation what does that mean you know that's true right prices fall the

00:10:11	marginal cost production and that should happen faster and faster that means that you've never lived in a free market ever you've lived in a control system you believe you've lived in a free market because your control system imposes um wealth destruction on other nations and steals their wealth to be able to make to make you wealthier you believe it but it's not true you live in a control system because the natural state of the global free market is deflation and all we do as humans we we are we we

00:10:44	are abundance creating machines out of scarcity that's what we do we see a problem we create we solve that problem with our minds by creating more more value and the output of that has to be faster uh faster abundance faster unless you've never lived in a free market um and so all of the constructs all of the fighting of this leader is better or this leader is better is is such nonsense complete nonsense right the is making that system Stronger by your belief of of it is better when it all relies on

00:11:25	theft interesting well look I think I know the answer to this question but I'm going to ask anyway so if what you're saying is true that all of the attempts by government to reign in spending and to control the debt are doomed to fail then why does it work on a company on the company size level why does it work for example at Twitter fire 80% of the employees get rid of all of that unnecessary spending and now Twitter's at a point where even though they make less Revenue than they did before they

00:11:52	make more profit that's you never hear about so why does it work at a company and it won't work for a nation state so what is the tech what is company do they remove the labor component of their business with technology yeah and of course that works right and if they didn't do that they would fail to a company that did that but they also eliminated unnecessary jobs they they ex so where and and as those jobs are eliminated prices should fall relative to the market right and and and that's exactly what they do and if they kept

00:12:22	them high if they kept all those jobs they would fail to a Twitter competitor right so that's that's why a company does it because they have to by the free market they're forced to become more efficient or fail but the government isn't forced to they're for they're forced now to go from two million employees to say 1 million employees say they fire half of the workforce and they can do the same amount of work they find other efficiency they find how does that not um how how does that not lead us to

00:12:49	a place where we we can actually get rid of the get rid of or or decrease the rate of debt because because the the debt is the currenc is the currency if you allow prices to fall so what just walk through that exact example I lose a million workers all those million workers and by the way it could be way higher than that because with AI where it's going it should be way higher than that right by losing a million workers all of those million workers today buy houses buy buy food buy they're spending

00:13:20	in the economy and the and so now you're not spending and it gets more efficient and all those people what do they do what they they don't spend right well they disappear into the look they've they've been giving a long Runway and they disappear and they're absorbed by the private sector okay but unemploy forever so no no here here's I think the thing that you're you're really missing because you're not tying these together the private sector is sacrificed for the public sector because of what I said so the

00:13:55	misallocation of capital is a direct response to not allowing prices to fall you have to you have to drive you have to drive higher regulation you have to drive misallocation of capital you have to make government bigger because the private sector is deflationary the private sector it makes more and more efficent more and more efficiency all the time so in response to that efficiency from a credit based system because if you allow that efficiency to flow prices fall and and what does that mean for the debt the debt gets more

00:14:32	expensive relative to the lower prices the debt keeps getting more expensive in other words the debt fails so that's what that's why so instead of letting the debt fail all of those jobs as they get absorbed there is no it's the fact you've created the private Market Market being under underwhelming because of all of the regulation and and the private Market is hugely efficient has to be right because otherwise it fails yeah so so in other words that private Market every single business right now they're using they're

00:15:07	using AI tools to remove labor why do you why do you why do you why do you think Facebook Amazon uh Google why do you think they're getting uh bigger and bigger and more powerful all the time and now and now going to government and they're in essentially Hoots with government to control this thing right because because they don't need the same labor per productivity it's a it's a platform that you use that extracts value and on on top of a broken system there they're just these giant monopolies that continue to remove labor

00:15:42	and you use them every day because if you don't use it because they give you more value but but at least as I understand that the prevailing narrative is that these companies do not wish they don't they only want the government to set the regulatory guard rail so that they don't break the law and it's the government that is insisting that they have these back door channels which you just saw with Europe the other day the companies themselves are not begging the government to come in that's at least

00:16:04	how I understand the narrative yeah it's not not true most of your narratives that you believe are are are from the existing uh structure of existing credit BAS system they would have to be right you live in a credit based system you believe all the economists that tell you about that you listen it's it's around all we've never lived in a truly Global free market as because you you know for sure prices would fall so you know for sure that that all of your narratives from that credit based system also must

00:16:35	be something's misaligned right something's wrong right that's why if you just get if you don't have falling prices the product the faster productivity gains means means prices should fall faster if that's not happening in your your economy then you know you don't live in a free market you live in a control system MH and and just that makes sense right like that makes sense I have examples that i' like some clarity but I also want to see what uh what what do you got what do you have to say yeah so for me like you know I'm

00:17:11	listening in and you know a lot of this stuff is where where okay for instance we we incre we increase productivity but we would have to the the output of that would be let's say get rid of the waste the wasteful productivity right so in a place where we're shifting into you know we're trying to shift into a a different structure right and like a paradigm shift right in between that time wouldn't a lot of people I I don't want to again I I have to kind of dig into really fully understand the the

00:17:46	transition but wouldn't people have to we can't eliminate people from suffering dur during that time yeah so so the suffering is so just like the the uh um uh uh deflation in the 30s that was caused by a massive buildup of credit that couldn't be paid back so it wasn't people think that that was the cause of the problem the great the Great Depression the cause of the problem was the Roaring 20s and a whole bunch of misallocated to Capital that had to be cleansed through the system and they get the they get what happen first inverted

00:18:24	all the time so they because it was such a painful event on society they go to that event and they say we can't let that happen again and actually make sure that that's going to happen again through the manipulation of currency right and so um the and so you have to go down to back to First principles and the first principles um of an economy are the natural state of the free market is deflation first principle of economy is prices F in in a free market Fall to the marginal cost of production from

00:18:58	there you can ask yourself questions what's the marginal cost of production of a line of Code Zero um that's why your calculator app on your phone is free right because first entrepreneurs come in and they create new new calculator apps that compete against Tas Instruments calculator and then they can become better and better and better and then as as you can make a dollar for and then you can make 50 cents 25 cents do p penny then they're all free and the entrepreneurs go somewhere else so from

00:19:29	the next question you have to ask what's the marginal cost of production of a line of code creating other lines of code less than zero zero right zero zero why do you think all the AI tools are becoming free and and they're getting better and better at an exponential rate deep seek than others and they just keep on I have seven different models on my computer if I ever lost the internet I have all of them for free forever right the entire history of knowledge different version of that history of

00:20:00	knowledge on my computer on this laptop for free so so if somebody's going to charge me for a model that says $20 a month and I get most of the functionality for free what would I do as an entrepreneur with that this would have to be so much better for me to use it because I would have to provide value to other people or fail so I would use the free one to Pro provide more value which means I would have a better value for others and that's why this continues to fall fall forever unless and going back to what Carlos was was

00:20:38	asking unless the big tech companies say we have to regulate that because people should be afraid of AI they're the they agricultural companies uh drug companies um military companies tech companies they're in favor of Regulation because that's how you protect a monopoly and so why do you think the why do you think all the lobbyists look like they do around around Washington and how much money is in lobbying and how much money is in in kind of backd door bribes to to to politicians it's because you

00:21:14	live in a system of theft that if you can get your thing designed so it's not a free market you can can create create a monopoly and then um you don't have to compete in a free market go I have a one one point and then a question so what I would argue is that these AI tools at some at one point they were the product but now they are being reduced down to what you said they're like a they're they're like a tool it's like a hammer right if hammers all hammers were zero dollars then the hammer itself has no value but what does

00:21:46	have value is how a person uses that hammer to create a product right and not everybody can wield the hammer the same way and I would argue that that's what the AI tools are going to be it's not so much about the tools themselves but it's about what people do with them that is the value creation so the value creation continues to move Downstream as the products and services get cheaper and cheaper and the yeah but the underlying thing that you're creating the value from is removing labor right because it does it better

00:22:14	than the labor used to do it it's able to see more patterns it's able and it's able to be and it will get in that labor reduction of your so here I'm going to read you something because somebody just sent me this and they used chat GPT to to to give a synopsis of the existing Financial system and and and CH GPT couldn't get the the answer it kept on regurgitating how essentially your model of the world right um and and and it kept out getting confused why would it get confused because there's way more

00:22:47	data supporting that model inside the model that would that would show that so so they were pushing back on chat GDP um and um with with my thesis and they sent it to me it said and here I'll read it it said shouldn't purchasing power increase over time I think the framework is skewed because the current monetary system and and looking at what has happened versus what should happen and then here's what Chad GB that's a great Point you're disc distinguishing between what should happen in a free market

00:23:17	under ideal conditions versus what has happened in the real world under constraints of the current monetary system if we assume that truly uh free market with sound money and techn technological progress purchasing power should increase over time one technology advancements reduce production costs goods and services become cheaper two productivity growth increases output for a worker wages should buy more three competition forces prices towards the marginal cost exactly what I just said excess profit margin shrink why

00:23:47	purchasing power hasn't increased as much as it should the core issue is that we don't operate in a free market instead we have an inflationary monetary system and and and and so those current that can't be allowed from the current monetary system and every single thing you do in the current monetary system and you give you feed it with more energy this is why I became I I I question Bitcoin I spent about 10,000 hours trying to attack Bitcoin trying to attack exact I knew this thesis was correct I knew for sure it was correct

00:24:23	then I could say say how much faster it would move and how most people would be confused by that through their actions and then I then I took the same type of rigor on bitcoin as I always took to the existing Financial system and I said so if we've never lived in a system free from corruption so for 5,000 years we've always lived in an exploitative system that then would get reset through war and and so it always look or kops in every different Nation it always looked the same um and we wouldn't have a we

00:25:00	wouldn't have any path to what it looked like again uh in in the future how what I what I said is how would Bitcoin possibly withstand what was coming against it because we must be part of the input that allows that to happen right because we um because if doesn't exist without us it doesn't exist without us we have to be both sides of it right we have to we have to believe in a hypoc almost hypocrisy that our most prices should rise un naturally well we only use things that give more value it makes it's l it's ludicrous

00:25:37	it's so we want everybody we our house prices should rise yeah well we will we create more Val the only reason house prices rise is because money goes down in value but isn't it also isn't it also scarcity no is it also like not no it's not it's because it's literally because the if you look at the host prices and the in fast gross grow growing cities or the the average house price it has gone up exactly in the hundred year last 100 years exactly the M2 rate the debasement of currency exactly matches it

00:26:13	perfectly so it is house prices aren't going up your money is going down Energy prices aren't going up your money is going down all of these things are a construct from the system that you're in and so how could Bitcoin resolve that Paradox um and I didn't think it could I thought it had a possibility but not a not the highest probability because because um because it would have to withstand every attack from our us right against this and all of the Power and all of the control structure and everything and the miscommunication and

00:26:48	all the noise it would have to withstand that then I realized that the decentralized nature decentralized and secure nature instead of saying Bitcoin say what if you had a decentral you couldn't change it because the nodes wouldn't allow you to change it right secure never been hacked impossible to to hack um uh protocol bounded by energy so was literally base one tied to energy what would it look like versus our perception of what it looked like if you couldn't change that then then it would measure the free market perfectly

00:27:24	prices would fall against it forever right and the only caveat I would say to that is as long as it stayed decentralized and secure the only thing you'd have to care about does it will this stay decentralize and secure so I spent like 10,000 hours trying to figure out could it stay decentralize and secure but if it if it was going to stay decentralized and secure then if I measured my house against the new energy protocol my house would be falling if I measured Energy prices against the new energy protocol

00:27:56	Energy prices would be falling if I measured anything they would all be falling it would be a perfect description a mere description of the global free market early emerging all prices would be falling like they should like what I read you like they should MH why because you couldn't change it you couldn't hack it you couldn't it was it was the energy based protocol What would most people look at it and it and it what and what that would mean is if you if you didn't have counterparty RIS if you held it in self- custody then this

00:28:32	entire other stack of all the debasement and all of the currency units and all the houses and all the businesses that all are predicated on more currency units being manipulated then they would all have counterparty risk every single thing in there every government every single thing would have counterparty risk and this would be the only thing without counterparty risk if you had in self- custody only thing on the planet without counterparty risk and and and what most people would do so I pric

00:29:01	this what we're talking about from Bitcoin I price the world from Bitcoin and everything makes perfect sense I live in the first truly Global free market it's it's emerging and it's getting easier and easier and easier and life gets easier because your purchasing power exactly what I read to you goes up over time from the um uh and will go up forever as more and more people move into the first Global free market because they don't have to wait they just have to move their time and they can contribute to it and gain from it

00:29:34	mhm and but what would it look like to to you if you were measuring Bitcoin from your from your debasing currency it would appear like Bitcoin was going up right faster than other assets but but but that was just that was that wasn't any it said nothing about Bitcoin it said about your perception of Bitcoin and what would it appear if you didn't have Bitcoin it would appear that you were getting debased at a crazy rate and that all those all those would be true based on each different Observer of the

00:30:13	new of this new essentially energy based system imposing new rules on society but it doesn't here's what I got to um I realized Bitcoin actually didn't care what I thought of it every time minutes there was a new block was every it didn't care it didn't care it never never cared what I what I thought a lot of people care what it does right but but it was imposing this new reality whether I cared or not and then I got kind of thought huh it doesn't say anything about Bitcoin if I want to give my energy to

00:30:54	the to the system based on theft mhm says something about me it doesn't say anything about because really what you have is two different systems one based on based on honest hard work honesty an honest Ledger that can't be debate can't be changed and then the other system you have you know a system based on theft it's so funny what what you're saying and the words that you're using are strikingly similar to the way that we discuss the perspective of people as they enter like the Event Horizon of a

00:31:30	black hole perspective when you see you know you see someone entering the black hole they red shift and they but then that from their perspective it's something else but in this analogy like Bitcoin is the singularity where once you cross that threshold basically everything all roads lead to it you can live outside of it once you get close enough or whatever it is all roads once you pass that event horizon Bitcoin is a point in your future right it's like that that that's it and every single government to every

00:31:57	single so I helped the city of Vancouver they're thinking of putting it on their balance sheet for the same reason as as everybody's putting it on on their balance sheet because for for me personally it means my purchasing power increases forever um what about a city well they take taxes from you to be able to provide services and by the time they spend on the services they can't provide the service they thought they were going to give because the money's broken so you you complain to them why are they

00:32:25	taxing me more and more and more it's because the money's broken because the services don't go as far and that that exists everywhere and then H and then we're inside that system trying to gain more money inside that system giving it of our strength yelling at this person or this person when we could just move our energy to the honest system so Jeff like you know I I do agree with your your your premise your concept about you know things should be you know things should be fair things should not be

00:32:58	corrupted like the like when we work the output of our work should be given to us for what it's for what the value is right and so what would you say because I think for me the hardest thing to grasp especially if I try to talk to people about Bitcoin that you know that are not in it right um you know they say things like well it seems like a lot of people who criticize Bitcoin they they criticize it because it's not tangible it's not something that they can touch you know it's not like a home um you know I I can't house a family

00:33:37	with it right um so which is interesting because do they crit do they criticize this uh podcasting thing or do they criti criticize Google or Facebook when they use these things every day that that that they can't touch right the the the the whole point of anything is to provide more value this is what what's different here is is this as a base layer provide more value to all all of society by imposing the free market you might not like it or not they might not like it but it again it's not negotiating with

00:34:18	them it it it doesn't care they should care but it doesn't it doesn't wow that's just powerful there I I I have I have a I have a question okay well first of all I found it interesting that in like the the the bull case that you were saying or the the weight of your argument was on the fact that it is decentralized and an immutable Ledger but you didn't speak anything about the finite Supply so so I so I I I consider that part of the unchanging rules okay because the because it went like incorruptible

00:34:58	changing so the so the way that the the that that works and the nodes control all of so my node run like has to confirm all the transactions what what that would mean is my node would have to vote against my best interests for a change like that and it won't happen but but do you see the fact that Bitcoin as a finite Supply as a fundamental reason why living within that system is is the the true free market yes yes it's a ledger that can't be manipulated it it's a ledger that can't be manipulated it's a ledger that

00:35:31	can't change why can't it change but it's not just that it's a whole bunch of different pieces about that that essentially enforces honest rules I download Open Source Code run a node that that my is are these transactions what they said they would be so it imposes essentially an honest Ledger and any like lots of people tried to cheat this FTX and and not the FTX just but I suspect through through banking fi government and everything else FTX wasn't just like if you think about the how much money was spread around

00:36:10	politicians this was this was an attack against Bitcoin um so that they could try to regulate so they they could uh they could all anybody who cheats Bitcoin gets wiped out and they always have when if you were just honestly Act with the honest Network and just bought it or held more of it instead to tried to consolidate it um you would do better than getting and it's which is which is fascinating right it's the only time in history we've ever had something that the cheaters get flushed out the honest

00:36:46	the honest Thrive that's true yeah the system we have now definitely rewards those who try to circumvent it or cheat it or game it yeah and this is the only thing that and and and how do you act how do you jump all you have to do is understand it run a node contribute to it and all of a sudden you're part of a global consensus Network that can't be cheated so I like to say we are Bitcoin it's not something outside of us it's it's put the honest in control of a network for everybody so it it inscribes

00:37:21	the best of us into a network for the best for us um that can't be cheated so as it as more more and more people come and try and cheat it and lots of people will they'll try to consolidate it that and um if you're if you're trusting somebody else in yourit to hold your Bitcoin you're introducing counterparty risk right you're intro and you're paying to introduce counterparty risk it it was just ludicrous right when when you can hold in self- custody have no counterparty risk of uh and and forever have have increasing purchasing

00:37:56	power mhm like why would you why why would you want to if you knew that if you knew what we just said if you're truly why would you be playing in meme coins why would you be playing in all of this nonsense well that's G like like and again I go to Vegas every once in a while I like gambling but I'm not like you don't have a big sh exactly but but you realize all of those things it's not just gambling it's perpetuating the crime of our existing Financial system which is based on theft right it's you're actively driving more and

00:38:39	more miscommunication more and more and because they're all zero some games somebody has to lose for you to win you you know you know Jeff the the thing that you say is though it's true right wouldn't it I mean I know you do your job you do your part you go into these pod you you know you pretty much you know try to educate as much as you can try to reach as much as possible as we do right but I feel like people have just been stubborn like I you know I know I'm measuring it from the old system but

00:39:12	when hit when Bitcoin hit a specific price Milestone nobody even cared and because people were still doubting it right so this and this is just going to reflect back on what I said is I I truly feel that before we shift into this different Paradigm I feel like people are going to have to suffer like people are going to be left behind I or so so you were right there like so so and I guess that's why I want to be careful of this this isn't a light switch this is going to happen for a long time and it's

00:39:46	going to be chaotic on both sides but but it can be a light switch for you each individual you live in a time where you you you could move to the honest Network and know no one can stop you you can put more time if you're spending 2% of your time there spend 4% if you're spending 4% spend 8% every time you move more time to the honest Network you will be rewarded more it might not happen immediately but it'll be it'll it'll be why rewarded more why it's really quite simple the every single scarcity in the world creates an

00:40:24	abundance from the free market so the scarcity of the the collapse of what the world's going through all of this nonsense and the chaotic nature and a whole bunch of people getting hurt there is the entrepreneurs building on top of Bitcoin right now and building all of the Rails to to to help them drive from this system so they can see it easier are getting rewarded at a at a crazy rate like we're investing in the space the rate of growth of companies who then denominate the B balance she in Bitcoin because they're

00:40:56	profitable in Bitcoin and adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet each month I cannot believe I get to do it and all it took is moving my time to be able to to see it so it would so I have empathy to what you're saying there's because is most of the problem today is just people don't see it they have no clue what's happening they're measuring that system from from the system and they're making it stronger with all their actions and they're feeling scared they're they're they're looking for any trying to make more

00:41:29	money making it worse thinking Trump trump and Elon are going to save me from those other bad people making it worse and and all of this is making the same same thing worse U worse and they're getting locked in locked in in their belief of of that all on top of a system that has to extract more value so is that going to be chaotic of course it's going to be chaotic um is that um is that what this had to look like to have a once this type of thing has never existed in human history um so it would obviously look

00:42:06	chaotic as you transition from very few people knowing it to more and more people knowing it and all of the kind of other layers of Technology they're building on top of Bitcoin to provide the transition it would look chaotic it would have to and I can empathize I can massively empathize with where people are but I don't want to be there and I don't have to be you can you can literally move your time as much as you want to move to to the new to the new system and as you move the new system you'll be rewarded

00:42:39	same as I've been rewarded I I so how I go through life right now is is I cannot believe I pinch myself that I get to do the things I get to do with the people I get to do with inside the first truly Global free market that's expanding globally I I go to Africa I go to South America I see people in villages that had nothing that are now contributing to this Global free free network that that they didn't have the access 10 years ago they were they were stuck in this extractive system and now they're not so

00:43:12	when you start to see that you see how fast that's moving around the world and then then somebody says from their their perspective of what it looks like and uh us today well that'll never happen okay see in 10 years yeah exactly like that cuz all that's happening to you from your perspective is the bitcoin's rate of return of the irr for the last 40 14 years 15 years is 45% compounded so yes some yes it's Vol volatile but there is nothing else and that's measured against the existing system so so if you want to buy houses

00:43:50	um and it's going up at 6% you're losing 39% a year against Bitcoin right and you're welcome to lose 39% a year um and and then you'll realize that as you lose 39% a year against against Bitcoin thinking that you're making money over those other people who losing more money than you because they don't have houses um and then your taxes go up on the same houses to be able to take it all back because those other people are so punished um it it seems pretty ludicrous to me but but a lot of people again so

00:44:25	to to your point heiny yes a lot of people are going to get crazy hurt and then they're going to get hurt again and they're going to get hurt again I use often example of Venezuela um in if everyone would know this right away what I'm saying right then all the people in Venezuela would be in on bitcoin already why do they still why do they still make their system stronger even though you've had massive hyperinflation destruction of all societies society's rues rule of law falls apart and they keep on making it

00:45:01	stronger the same reason you do exactly the same reason you do because you're measuring your world in a piece of paper and you're making it stronger so so so why would we expect other people than and and so it's it's a personal each individual person has a choice to move more of their time and and and and when they do what they'll find is others around them start to as well why because it's so much more rewarding it's so much easier to see and you don't have to make anybody do it they say what do they say like um

00:45:39	people find Bitcoin when it's when it's ready like it's always the right time you're ready for it totally um so I I have a question I don't know if you're familiar with the principle of the 10th man it's this principle in Israeli Parliament after they received an attack and they said well we should have seen this attack coming but the the 10 people that were on the committee we're all in agreement that we shouldn't be yeah we shouldn't be considered this threat so they invented the 10th man which is now

00:46:03	in every committee if nine people agree it is the job of the 10th person to prove them otherwise and try to like you said counter and try to prove that the opposite is true so that being said if I take you at face value that all you know that um Technology's def deflationary force is inevitable what like one Innovation could you think of that could unexpectedly like derail or accelerate this timeline that you're saying so what which one would you like me to start on accelerate or um one yeah so um in my

00:46:34	book I wrote uh um I wrote about um exponential technology and I and I and I use a paper folding example and I fold a p piece of paper 50 I said on 50 folds you can only fold at seven but on 50 folds how thick is the piece of paper I've asked this question tens of thousands of times all over height to theight of station yeah so it goes yeah it goes to the Sun but think about how much different Carlos your your your uh your first guess was than the sun right and most people even if they get that parlor trick most

00:47:10	people say guess two inches or to the ceiling and it's so we're so staggeringly wrong but that's the same thing that happens in technology um and and what ends up happening is you overestimate the impacts early AI overestimating the impacts early and has had the same same rate of growth exactly the same rate of growth for the last 75 years um it's just an exponential pattern that then you you overestimate early in the 50s then you massively underestimate because where are we right now we're in fold 36 moving to fold 37

00:47:45	on Mo's law so now we're in the Steep steps and people are wonder how is this coming so fast when it's going to come and they're they're still looking backwards looking forwards it's and and all of that productivity growth is productivity growth which is faster deflation which is the rise of a debt based system more manipulation of The Debt Pay system and more and more control so how fast is this coming it's coming at a staggering rate what uh what are some risks to it uh uh risks to what what I'm talking about here's here's one

00:48:19	um it's not I I don't see it as a real risk but it's risk for you if you are aggregating in the centralized system the two systems are opposites one is the free market one is not so if you're measuring bitcoin price in a US dollar which one are you in if you're measuring it in USD old well then you're in the you're in the old system you're in you're in you're in the control system and from the control system what you will likely do is take more risk you'll think oh I'm going to just trust my Bitcoin in the bank I'm going to trust

00:48:51	it in the ETF and it won't be your Bitcoin it be somebody else's Bitcoin and that Bitcoin has to centralize and more and more people will sell their Bitcoin for that thing and they'll centralize faster and faster from the system that must centralize and and a lot of people inside that it will still go way up in value versus that that that currency and a lot of people will sell for that at that time and and and wow I'm rich now and centralized further if it looked like that in time that would be that would look like imperialism 2.0

00:49:23	US Dollar on bitcoin it would look like gold back to uh then I move from the gold Reserve I move to the Petr dollar I I I Engineer a system around in oil and it if anybody doesn't use my system they're invaded or cut off from the financial global system that same thing could happen on top of Bitcoin if this got centralized um but it um which it likely happens because of our actions trying to Central thinking that there's no risk there right because we've never had a non- counterparty risk asset but here's what's more than likely

00:50:00	to happen out of that the people who cheat Bitcoin always get wiped up and the no and those people who are doing that aren't running nodes right so they're taking a massive risk um and and they will likely get wiped out because the nodes will enforce the rules and wipe out that entire system at some point if it tries if it tries to do a chain Fork on on what we're talking about so but to say that that's not a risk and again I'm aware of lots of different things I watch all the time but but the but what ends up happening

00:50:35	is when you're inside the system when you're inside the new uh new honest protocol you also realize how many others are are Way Forward of these risks and have already built all of the all of the things that would nullify these risks before before they come because that's what that's what a consensus mechanism look that realizes how important this is would do MH so just to just to sort of adopt your thinking a way of looking at it is to say say you know a house price in 2018 is $500,000 and in 20 uh 20 it's

00:51:16	$700,000 and in 2022 it's $900,000 that's not the way to look at it what you're saying is the way to look at it is that house in 2018 would cost you 30 Bitcoins and in 2020 that same house would have cost you 10 Bitcoins and in 2024 that same house might cost you four Bitcoins and that's the way to look at it that you're buying actually increasing over time and eventually the house is one Bitcoin th this this this house five years ago was uh was $1.4 Million this house that I'm saying is is now $2.1 million in Canadian dollars or

00:51:51	just pieces of paper that most people measure the world in um but in Bitcoin 5 years ago it 300 Bitcoin right now it's now it's 22 Bitcoin MH and so so what's happening but from the energy based system the energy based system the house is falling to its utility value MH houses used to be a utility before they before you had to use them to store your value because money couldn't store your value right right what happening to the miners I mean eventually the miners will be a public utility in the same way that

00:52:26	you know we have water electricity like those miners will eventually be another public utility yeah and I don't and and I don't even think they I think they'll constantly go around the world I've been all around the world watching a miners so so here's a way to look at a minor uh the M the economics of A Minor remember I'm on on the board of a public one that's giant right the core scientific but if you look at the economics the the two major inputs are the the the uh as6 the the compute and the energy so so you're you're forcing

00:53:03	to you're forcing puncture is to CH is to chase lower uh energy costs and and abandoned energy or stranded energy and it it moves around the world and that's also part of the decentralization that the nodes really lock in those rules but those economic actors are going where energy is the cheapest um I use and so so essentially you for the first time in history you have a global free market in energy too and it works like this H's probably heard this before but Carlos if you had a bakery um and I came in one day and I

00:53:38	said listen I'll buy everything that you produce extra that you don't sell next day you produce two times as much I come in I wanted a discount but I buy it all next day you produce four times as much I buy it all next day you just say I'm going to I'm going to buy some more ovens Capital cost I'm going to hire more people to produce unlimited bread I come in and I buy it all what do we just do by having an always on buyer at the margin we just created abundant bread that's all a Bitcoin now insert

00:54:09	energy for for for bread and that's and that's all of Bitcoin minor is you have a always on buyer who will always buy at at a lower lower price and uh and so you're chasing Global energy and and you're overbuilding overbuilding capacity anywhere because you always have a about buyer but if uh if and when um say if you if you reduce some of the nodes that are on the network then the difficulty goes down and the energy needed to mine the Bitcoin also goes down don't you also create a surplus in energy I'm

00:54:42	talking like in the future as eventually some of these miners get weeded out and you don't need as many nodes to to yeah so so so so that's that difficulty adj adjustment is a really great piece because it forces it it forces it's always harder right so there is it forces the free market right that that you can't consolidate a market here and so what ends up happening is that if you're paying too much for energy you get liquidated and all your equipment gets bought by somebody else who doesn't have

00:55:14	the Deb and and goes and takes it and lower and mines on lower cost energy mhm interesting I've never really thought about it this way it's interesting but but and then measured against abundant energy because we're finding new energy sources all the time we're finding new distribution and fracking and different energy sources if you measure energy against against Bitcoin you can see the prices of energy are falling as they should fall in a free market so all of the it's it's B you have a new protocol bounded by

00:55:49	physics it's bounded the free market is bounded by that that energy energy is life and we're both advancing more energy abundance of energy through this protocol and securing everything on top of a new energy back protocol yeah and then what ends up happening in a mine in raw materials that you're pricing and why would those prices fall because if you look at a mine today versus a mine 50 years ago there's way less labor in a mine today there's automated trucks there's self-driving trucks and it's getting more and more

00:56:25	like that all the time so now you have lower energy costs you have lower people costs and you have so all of these inputs of everything is falling at the same rate that I just that should happen if you don't measure that from a piece of paper I mean I I have a lot of questions related to that but like we you know we did say that we would I'm try to keep this to to an hour I don't know if you have any of your main questions I do have a question to follow up on that but I want to see if hind these anything

00:56:57	especially in response to what yeah so for um so for me I think one of the things that um one of the things that I I did find about your book is and mind you Jeff I read the book just recently right so in my perspective had I read this you know in 2019 2020 right I would probably have to read it like 10 more times just to see it play out but since I read it this year or you know a little bit started last year I said wow Jeff wrote this in 2019 pretty much everything is is coming into fruition right so if I was to ask you one thing

00:57:35	that because I know you ended the chapter with or the book with with the last chapter talking about Bitcoin right you you didn't really dive into Bitcoin yeah there's only one paragraph yeah so with what we just talked about right the fears things that we you know people are going to be shocked when when when these things eventually happen right what would be your last what if you were to add another chapter to your book and it hasn't happened yet or you haven't you know pretty much it hasn't come into

00:58:04	full fruition um what would that chapter look like and what would you discuss um it would talk about the the world you see is literally a miror reflection of your beliefs um and and and we that world comes into a fact we both are the contributors to it and it comes into effect by those same beliefs but we think it's somebody else so it so if I I if you've heard some of my work before if I walked down the street with somebody who showed up as a victim right everything always happens to that person and and you could

00:58:47	ask why does that happen because and why it happens is we're in search of Ling belonging and love and belonging is all around us all the time but the victim doesn't realize might realize that same thing but that but to get love and belonging they show up as a victims and to try to get that and then as everybody moves further away they double down on more drama to try to get people to come back what they don't realize uh is is the world is a complete reflection of their beliefs and love and belonging was

00:59:18	all around them all the time but they're pushing it away with a sign on their forehead trying to get it so if that's true with that person then and you see this in every single person you meet their own views of the world they're so sure of that view of the world and it's hurting their own own whatever they say they want and it happens and what I realize is if this happens to everyone else it must happen to me too so where um you take credit for the things that are good in your life and then you blame where where it's

00:59:50	not and if you just were just really honest and said it's all me you would find the things in you that that that were stopping you from this and and so if I take that back to we're walking down the street we would see two different realities right and my and and my reality would be totally true for me and I would see abundance and I would see love I would see all of these things and I'd see opportunities everywhere and that person wouldn't I didn't say mine was right and theirs wasn't right they're both right

01:00:24	they're both true they're just different we live in a construct of those different ideas and different different views all in an intricate weave across space and time of each individual person that's what that's what we look and those ideas bump into each other and either thrust us out of a belief set or don't what we're doing right now and maybe hindy on on my book might have thrust you into a new potential belief set right that potentially impacts your life really positively or takes you on it or or somewhere else where where uh

01:01:03	where you find something else and then that'll touch somebody else that everything we live around everything that you can look at from this the the surroundings I meant come out of our mind that we create out of our mind right that and and and so so how powerful an idea that is if we are uniquely responsible for that and we added more mines so what I think is happening on bitcoin is you have you had um the printing press opened up more Minds it allowed more contribution before from a control structure that was

01:01:44	very narrow and most people were slaves in that control system it opened up we were both able to read other people's thoughts error correct on those thoughts and contribute to those thoughts and so us as a supercomputer what we're doing right now creates more value because there's more shots on net and all of the things that came out of the uh that we we are living on top of right now but it's probably only unlocked 500 million mines s and a half billion are still stock and because and they're stock and they're stock all over the

01:02:19	world because they live in monetary slavery because of this right so they are they are the counterparty to living in in in success their currencies have to fail faster and they're living in this poverty and everything and so if if part of what is driving who we are and allowed to be or be out of ideas like Faraday and Ma James Clerk Maxwell and Einstein and all of these ideas that we long since forget these people but the ideas are a fabric of Creations MH and we only have 500 million people contributing and that's taking Humanity

01:02:56	a long way right but still s and a half billion people are living in AB poverty and in control systems and dictatorships and everything else what would it look like if we added eight billion people in the world in the world in service of us wow we would have more time that's you not just more time you would find Einstein's everywhere you would find and all of those people through the free market have to contribute to all of us through that same process and you're going to unlock that talent and you're

01:03:24	going to have productivity gains that move FAS and if you're in Bitcoin and you're really in Bitcoin that's what you're measuring and I'm watching people get unlocked into it so when people question this or when they kind of on the others I don't care right I don't um because I'm watching what I just described and it is beautiful it is so beautiful and this is what you mean by like your have multiple um you know conversations with people when you say Bitcoin doesn't care if you hate it or not it's going to

01:03:56	bring you value no matter what and yeah because even if you didn't even if you didn't own any Bitcoin um and this transition happens then then what it means for you is you're living in a world where you don't uh where you don't need very much money prices keep falling right things the the governments gets smaller and serves you rather than Praise on you it forces all of these things that you that right now the number of people if you just ask a really simple question um what is the problem you're worried about most and

01:04:37	how do you fix that problem by creating more monetary units more pieces of paper you they'd realize you can't all problems get worse so how would you fix that problem don't get what people don't get is that the creation of new money is dilution if you understand it in the stock market when you have your shares and they d loot you people understand it but I don't think the general public or the masses really understand that every new dollar created is just dividing the current value of what's already there by

01:05:06	more units yeah this is not something that's understand understood as a whole and I don't think our media our governments by Design explain that to the population and and or but not just media and governments think about economists like there isn't an economist who's argued me with me on my core thesis there there's I think they're they're literally scared to because you can't like how do you the yeah exactly price is Fault marginal cost production in a free market the free market is deflationary those are

01:05:38	those those are facts so what does it say about all economists what does it say about all of the infrastructure because what what it actually says is is to get paid I have to convince people that inflation is normal right the um I have to convince people that that's a norm there is no normal inflation the natural state is deflation not from zero negative and so so the money the money isn't being stolen if you had 5% inflation measured from zero it's not being stolen from zero it's being stolen from probably

01:06:16	ne6 um and and so that that entire that entire infrastructure all of those jobs aren't needed um the people who don't want to trust who don't think they're smart enough to understand economics are are perfectly easy to understand economics is like crazy simple prices full the marginal cost of production in a free market intentional or is it ignorant these these the ones that that should know better and don't speak this information to the masses is it intentional or is it ignorance well well Carlos in in this this is why I

01:06:54	wanted say this I'll bet you some of the things we're talking about right now for you for you and you talk about this are new they're so hard to understand because you're so we're so wired into the existing existing model and then a lot of times and this is what sometimes frustrates me in Bitcoin is the minute somebody gets it in Bitcoin they think they're smarter and better than everybody else and they talk to everybody else like that and it's just this is a really hard thing done understand because you're so wired your

01:07:29	entire life has been wired into the other system so you have to you have to be curious and um and and open to where I was wrong before what I thought before to be able to and if you're not open to you could have been wrong you won't get it okay I have a I have another question this is this is about like like looking forward into the future if this deflation if we if we do move say to more to a Bitcoin standard and deflation accelerates to and traditional jobs vanish uh faster than we're able to

01:08:07	adapt how do people find purpose in that world when you're Sur when your when work isn't tied to your survival I mean it sounds like we need like a cultural uh Revolution as much as we need an economic one yeah do they get lazy Jeff like yeah how does that how does that yeah and all of these things are you can imagine how much time I've spent on this 0,000 more than that though but like like way more than that to even to come up with the book I'm talking about just on bitcoin but it asks right now I know

01:08:39	this I know everything we're talking about am I lazy now no like there will always be problems to solve There Will and and the free market just will you will trade with anybody anywhere if they give you more value right so that's what the free market does so it's good for them it's good for you it's good for everyone because the output of that trade is more value and then they then the person that is giving you more value everyone else competes with them to give you more value right that's so you trade with

01:09:16	people who G who give you more value that's the way the the world works so that output is and and then we will solve other problems we'll keep on solving problems we'll keep on and the output of all of it will be prices will fall faster and faster but then what are the safeguards against some new Elite Class that controls the tech you know arriving um so how do you so this is this is seriously this is the point that I'm like how do you control you can't control a decentralized protocol bounded by energy if you could there are no

01:09:48	safeguards so right now why ultimately the reason why Elon is not in in uh in Bitcoin or not advocating for Bitcoin and I'm advocating on Twitter and everything else look it where all of his wealth comes from it's all subsidies and government contracts yeah um so why would you why would the richest person in the world want to give up what get what was a driver of all of their wealth which is a control system to share that broadly with everyone um and and and that and and I don't I don't hate Elon I just

01:10:28	know the incentives in this so uh so that that control system if it's extractive will centralize and there will be very few people on to so what would AI look like in a control system there's really two ends right prices of everything fall to the marginal cost of production and now as the jobs get removed from from society we live in abundance that's one end that's Bitcoin and in that what that means is Bitcoin is by far the best investment in Ai and everything else because it captures all productivity

01:11:04	gains right that's what that's what Bitcoin is on one end of the spectrum and it's decentralized and secure other end of the spectrum through Fiat all of those current all of those productivity gains as people still lose their jobs gets concentrated in very few companies and power and AI is used against you mhm robot dogs drones everything Black Mirror to be able to control you and and now now the the really this might some some of your viewers won't like this you might not like this you are actively making a

01:11:40	choice every day which one you're making true actively well CH Choose Wisely so so so that's it so every day you're contributing to the Fiat system that is happening at a faster and faster rate and you're looking at other people to blame those other people and when when you realize huh it's me yeah like there's an off-ramp it's it's it's me it's a for I did the same thing this is why I say that I I I realized I was a hypocrite in what I was doing I was talking all over the world my book became an

01:12:16	international bestseller for largely the same reason you guys just said because it predicted what would happen and and it predicted essentially all the timing everything that would happen and I had a hedge in Bitcoin and I was on all these boards and and some of the ones that you mentioned before Fiat companies and everything else and I was on all those and I I woke up one day and I went oh my God I'm a hypocrite I know all of this and 90% of my time is in the Fiat world trying to make more money in that so I

01:12:48	can buy more Bitcoin and I just said I'm not doing it anymore I'm out of all those and I'm move and that's why created The Venture Fund in Bitcoin so I could move all of my time to where I wanted to go I'm not and I'm not saying anybody should do what I just said they don't have to do that I'm not trying to make you feel bad in this I just realize for my own for my own hypocrisy that I had I had to resolve the conflict for myself well the the majority of my net worth now is in Bitcoin but even you're

01:13:23	making me feel like I'm not bullish enough but but but even but if it if it's not just forget just the the the network then go spend in it go go on Noster create an account on Noster go start communicating in it go to events go to um and as you spend more you're going to see way more opportunity you're going to see a whole bunch of people who are also contributing there you're going to you're going to kind of fall in love with how fast this is moving and you're going to see more opportunity than you

01:13:54	otherwise would have in the other construct what' you say it was nost Noster how do you spell it no o s um it's a decentralized it's built right on top of Bitcoin it's integrated yeah so so you could go to Primal or damis um primal's easy to get set up and you can and T tag me and I'll send you I'll send you a zap I'll send you some Bitcoin I see dude he's inv je Booth is inviting us to do this okay I mean it's going to happen Jeff I just got to say I think what I appreciate about you the most is

01:14:32	I think everybody agrees that have spoken with you is you're just so humble like you kind of break you break it down even though it's very complex and as you always say it's complex you break it down into simpler forms to simp for us to understand and you always you always emphasize things like oh yeah I'm I've already you know I've already gone through this rabbit hole right you always say that like always use those words and I think for me I think what we what I definitely me I appreciate it about you the most is

01:15:04	pretty much every week I see you doing the work by just dig digging deeper and deeper into that rabbit hole and you're just you're just asking people like hey um you know come and learn right you can follow me if you want but I'll still be doing the work so I think that's the one thing that you know again I I very humbled that you're here I've learned a lot with this an hour and 19 Minute Podcast with you so and I'm going to I'm going to continue to learn um um as I'm sure Carlos will um and and be humble

01:15:37	like just like what you said is um a being part of the space is you're not supposed to know everything about Bitcoin right and and for me I think that's that just brings me closer to my investing kind of future and what my goals will be and so again thank you Jeff yeah no problem really appreciate it my my my final question just sort of as a fun way to end it just as like a thought experiment is that you know governments and central banks are are addicted to controlling via inflation but if you

01:16:07	could sit down with one historical figure that you believe helped shape modern economics like who would it be and how would you convince them to buy into your vision so I actually think that there's a lot of uh so there's no one per person um in this I think I think Hayek knew this I think a lot of the uh um I think Lots I think Henry Ford knew this I think Buckminster Fuller knew this I think Nicole tesna knew this I think some of the religious yeah I think some of the religious figures throughout time knew

01:16:36	the same thing but they were up against a a structure that wouldn't allow it you until this was vented until this discovery was was here you you couldn't overcome the worst of us the greed in in in humans to be able to to create a system like this because we would say would say that yes we would want to live in the system but we would only do it if everyone else did it no one else would do it and it would it would always resolve it would back go back to a different system so so I actually believe that a

01:17:08	lot of the these Bright Lights throughout time we're talking about the very same thing and and in in in that I don't think my stuff is any is not I don't think it's new I think it's rediscovered right it's the that that this was always there and and and certain people could see it um and they acted as beacons but you'd never actually were able to put it all together into a system that could could work and now we actually have that chance to to move from an extractive exploitive system that we've always

01:17:45	lived in to a system that operates different and it's our CH it's our choice so um lots of people I'd want to talk to uh lots of people that I would love to uh uh uh check if that was right but I suspect through I do a lot of reading I suspect that that's right they just you weren't able to put it all together I I interpret that much like you know kernic is talking about the Earth is not the center of the exact exactly and but it it was true even at the time that people didn't believe it yeah and it was still true the hundred

01:18:19	or so years later when people finally accepted it but it was always true exactly it's just y yeah and and and if you think about what we do in physics or any single we're constantly looking for deeper meanings and what what Hy said before if you if you can't if you can't explain it simply enough you don't understand it simply enough right the the Einstein's favorite famous quote on on that if you can't explain it the Eli five yeah um and so and I think that's what's happen as you come down to greater truths you

01:18:56	start to realize it is actually quite simple it's unifying and and it unlocks and but but I just had somebody called me this morning um said the same thing effectively that hiny said they this this thing that I talk about they can't resolve in their head it's acts like a like an virus they can't they they constantly see it all around technolog is moving faster and faster and they can't and it's the cognitive dissidence of knowing that that's true for sure and then measure trying to measure that

01:19:27	truth from the other system that's kind that's creating this this but which means everyone will go through it and they'll get there eventually well I I want to thank you for the time this a fast I know this this is too short man questions and I have to pick like my my top questions I hope that we get to do this again I really appreciate the insight and it's also now I have even more questions than answers which is I think a mark of a good a good podcast right awesome awesome really appreciate that and I

01:19:57	know there's gonna be tremendous value created for the people that listen to this Jeff I hope awesome really I hope this is not the last time Jeff I really hope we got to do this again yeah after they Bitcoin Reserve we gotta come back here and talk about we'll do it again Jeff thank you thank you very much you have a good one take care thanks guys you too bye bye
