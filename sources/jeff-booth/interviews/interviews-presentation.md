Jeff Booth - We are in fold 34: How exponentially will change our understanding of economics
thanks everybody it's a huge honor to be here um so so you set that up perfectly um this is going to be provocative um and um and system changes that we're going through we're going through it is very likely that you measure a system from the system so a lot of the things that i'm going to say are going to potentially feel very very different from your mental model of what the world looks like today so first i just want to start by doing this if i if i fold this piece of paper once twice three times four times i keep folding it on itself if i fold it 50 times how thick is a piece of paper inch meter um that piece of paper would reach the sun so so and and i don't do that to i don't do that to uh say okay you don't get it um that the average answer the 19.9 percent of the people that i ask this question to and i've asked this question to tens of thousands of people all over the world and audiences like this guess two inches guess you're an inch and then when they hear it later on that it reaches the sun they go and they go and google that and then they think they know exponential patterns because they know a parlor trick and they tell their friends how they know exponential patterns and that and if you didn't get that answer and it's impossible to get that answer nor i couldn't get that answer the first time that i saw it's impossible unless you're actually thinking exponentially and we live in a world that's moving exponentially on moore's law you must ask yourself what else might you miss because we're and it's the same same reason than in in what's happening in technology doubling at the rate it's every eighteen months to two two years it's a massive chaos and change is coming through society that we're not prepared for because we're not thinking in those terms uh some of the business people are i create technology companies for a living i know how to create systems to take advantage of that by predicting where technology is going on that trend um but but most people including economists including the the highest people in society today don't think like that nor why would they because they've never had to technology's never moved that fast i'll give you and if you think about that just in in what i'm saying and you go um why is there always a hype cycle in technology the hype cycle is actually created from the same thing in the early folds when we see robotics when we see ai when we see 3d printing in the early folds some people tell us wow this is going to change the world and it does that it does nothing and that keeps folding it keeps doubling and it keeps doubling in the later folds we underestimate that by a staggering degree a staggering degree and and so if we're unfold 34 right now and if you think about moore's law in in 34 doubles what happens in 18 months so when we're measuring backwards looking back at at our historical models what happens going forwards and it's going to be a little bit of the talk today so you can see this right before um 1985 the apple computer had 25 000 transistors the one launch last week has 57 billion transistors one last launch last week is 1.5 times faster than one last launch last year and it'll use a 60 less power and so what that what happens here is our world is moving faster and faster and faster way faster than we can predict and we don't predict the future we look backwards at historical patterns and we predict the present forward and and in that prediction problem we don't actually we don't predict ourselves changing we think everything else will change but our minds won't change we stay the same everything else changes so we predict our present forward and not seeing this actually that's what entrepreneurs do they take advantage that's what i do in business you take advantage of that what the world believes as a foundational belief and you think wait with technology i can create way better outcomes for people and if that those better outcomes are found by the market more people will change their mind from what they believed here and do something different and i i i look back at things like this i think when when um when um when we when walmart came into town in in north america everybody would talk about why don't uh why don't people support main street and the same people that are talking about well why don't you support main street shop to walmart um and and so you predict what everybody else should do but you do something that you do something different as something gives you more value and those prediction problems [Laughter] um uh but i i do this not to point out um specifically krugman here but ben two thousand or 2005 or so it'll become clear the internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than fax machines but but underestimating that metcalfe's law produces some pretty big errors here's what he said in 2013 defending this quote he said he said i'm an economist i rarely make predictions on technology nor should i okay think about that that's like a doctor saying i'm a doctor i'm a surgeon i shouldn't understand how the heart works or like a or like a captain of a ship saying saying i shouldn't understand whether because i because i'm gonna say i'm a sailor um if if econo if the economy is more and more transitioning to digital economy and an economy is on the nature very nature of a digital transition if you don't understand that digital transition you're going to be left out in the cold and what does that mean and so so if you and what does it mean specifically for economics kodak invented the digital camera um kodak is no longer relevant because they defended a monopoly around distribution and that distribution and so now think about that digital camera what you got that that digital camera a 3d digital camera that is going to usher in 3d world on your phone is a five dollar bill of materials on the iphone today um 15 years ago that would have been 10 years ago five years ago it would have been six hundred dollars so you couldn't do that but technology getting smaller and smaller and smaller and so what does it do for you it gives you more for less we have an abundance in photos we have an abundance we have an abundance in editing software it's all free it's uh the very nature of that abundance creates deflation it gives us more for less and that's why we use it that's why we create those monopolies because rational actors choose things that give them more value what did it do to the music industry music industry was uh was at its peak it's about half of what it was at as a peak as as it transitions to a digital world now think of all the artists that were blocked by the existing monopolies that we could have never found we listen to more music more diversity of music today we get more for less and it costs less and that very nature of that happening across our societies is is deflationary look at your phone things turn into information things that think about your desk 20 years ago calculator all of the different things on your desk that are now an app on your phone things turn into information and information information trends towards its marginal cost of production the marginal cost of production with artificial intelligence moving at the rate it is trends towards free and so so you ha you have this force of good in the world that we all use the technology that's actually we use technology to free our time same reason i use technology in my businesses is to make more value to deliver more value to society and if i don't do that that construct my business fails and so you have one path that's trying to do that and another path that's fighting that and so i'll show you this video this is 10 years ago awesome dynamics [Music] seven years ago [Music] one year ago [Music] this here [Music] and again in that ask yourself if you saw the video 10 years ago would you have predicted today and you can see that prediction problem and and ask yourself if you also if you see that where will that be in 10 years from from now because what you'll capture in your brain is that going forward and you capture those machines going forward instead of them miniaturizing an ai moving ever everywhere and it looking totally different that is the picture you'll capture and you might see that picture with guns on it and everything else and who who controls that picture but you won't see what actually happens because technology is still moving at that rate so you have these and and this affects everything you have these collision of two giant forces technology on one one side wanting to free our time if you think about money just as a concept it's an abstract concept for our time and we use technology to give us more time that's why we use it we could we could dig holes with spoons we don't because we save time with technology and that technology is now transferred to a point largely because of those folds to a point that it doesn't look like it used to it's moving so fast it doesn't and it changes everything and you have central banking and i could have put inflation here or central banking i'm not trying to do this to to push to say it's any person's fault that's really important it's a it's a it's a mistake of of unable to grasp what's happening with technology in a system that's reinforcing itself and those systems can't or cannot work together they're polar opposite systems so so what would it what would it look like if you if you tried to drive inflation in a massively deflationary world and think about what inflation is we don't we don't even question it we say an economy requires inflation because does anybody ask themselves why is it is there a rule that says we can't live in a productive society without money be losing its value every year because money two percent inflation is really just a theft that transfers money to the wealthy from the poor and and so we don't question the two percent incorporation or if is that okay or five percent inflation isn't okay twenty percent is it we don't question we don't say the rate of theft is okay or and and i inaudib why when i say the fraud those are harsh words but it's why because you me everybody will always vote to to get more than we can get actually get so we'll vote in people who tell us this little lie that we can pay for something that we can't and so sis that system requires that because we vote for that system feeds back on itself and feeds back on itself and feeds back on itself and it gets so large and those those two forces right now are getting further and further apart so if you let um if you actually let deflation work in in the natural economy what would happen a credit-based system collapses to the ground everything every institution on top of it bank failures it would it would it would be horrific but same in the same breath that's what has to happen at some point so how do you how do you deal with those things so when i was writing my book one of the things i i i thought okay if technology is moving this fast there must be some artifact evidence that um of of being offset that technology declining something must be pushing prices up and offsetting that so so this is the end of 2019 approximately 250 trillion dollars of debt to run an 80 trillion dollar global economy but this was a smoking gun 185 trillion dollars of that debt came in the last 20 years and and so from the system when you know one system is going one way one system has to go the other you could predict what has to happen with kovid you could predict what has to happen with with how much more debt has to go in to offset everything and that debt or that inflation or to try to monetize that stealing from society to do it what would that then move into and the signposts are everywhere um your um that that amazon picture is from mexico in the slums you have uh you have this amazon warehouse it's it's kind of stark you have record inequality because what is inflation the other side of the coin of inflation is wage deflation so you're telling you're telling an entire audience that we're going to pay you less so you have more jobs on an ever increasing basis so so essentially you end up concentrating all wealth and control on very few hands as a.i keeps moving and what that looks like and you get social destruct the societal collapse be all over the world and that societal collapse is caused by and those same people that are getting hurt most turn to the same governments who who even if central banking was neutral it can't stay neutral it gets co-opted by governments because the people demand that it gets co-opted by governments because most of the people are hurt by the same process but they don't know why they haven't put it together why they're why they're hurt from that process and so and that and and and you get regulatory capture and you get uh and and and it keeps on accelerating and we've seen this throughout history on the on these changes and a lot of people talk about kind of the misinformation today and i think they potentially get a little bit wrong and every technology by lowering the cost that threshold creates more brains kind of contributing to world knowledge so if you think about the printing press church had monopoly power over information printing press lowered the threshold for more more people to contribute galileo ostracized by the by the by the church they took off as middle finger jail everything else but but those those signals that put an incongruence with the teachings of the church that were the real signal lived on and they were and and the best signals that that that information that that real really powerful information demands an answer and so the signal cuts through the noise with clarity and people okay now i need to know this i need to know this i need to know this which takes away that same power over time and you're seeing a similar thing a lot of misinformation in the signal as well tons of misinformation as this is the internet has brought way more voices on social media is about my voices but the signal one of the reasons probably my book became a bestseller is because it's hard to argue something like this that demands an answer and and more and more people talking about it start to produce that signal now they can question is it that i made a mistake in the thesis everything else the more people start to do it deepen you you you change minds and and when again when you think about and i'm really deep on on ai but if you think about our biological computer on how we learn it's a slow process and it's an error correction process of practice practice practice but we harden those what ends up happening in our own brains we harden those mental models and because we can't investigate them down to the ground they say like like we like we used to we harden it and and we take shortcuts we build on top of those mental models i would argue today that the entire monetary system is one of those shortcuts that most people just take for granted and built on top and build on top of that and and they can't see this it is literally blind to a lot of people until you bring it into view talking through different language and so what happens with that you have one path that we know we know most of the deflation's in front of us not behind us we have another path we have the same path that we know that central bank the the that currency cannot exist that monetary policy can exist without that and it has to keep printing or you'll have a complete uh credit collapse and and and and a depression that would make uh a great depression look on steroids and so everything would collapse you would have it in i often ask which snowflake causes the avalanche what people are doing is looking around at the snowflakes talking about the snowflakes instead of the system and the fragility that's building into the system because of this talk because of this and so it enters a paradox and that paradox is a really hard thing for our brains to solve and here's the paradox accelerating digital air technology growth requires a digitally native currency that allows for deflation i and i'm going to put a caveat here it doesn't require it if you if you concentrate all power and control in a small group of people who determine what's good for everybody else it doesn't require somebody could just say i'm gonna and and that is the path that we're heading without what i what i wrote here that is the pat that is the path that short-term nature to kick the can down the road is creating greater greater instability all over the world and a system built on credit can't allow that for fear of that cascading credit collapse so how do you solve that paradox and and i mentioned this before but but again most people think housing goes up forever and they think housing goes up forever because they're measuring a system from a system that there was 185 trillion dollars of stimulus to create housing going up forever in the last 20 years they don't realize that that the negative externality of that to somebody else that's rents are going up and higher higher and higher is a staggering missile and you can't fix the system from that system but we measure everything from that system everything and so it's hard to step out of the system um to measure something from a different system and i figured that this conference would like this quote but um but i think it's actually really important to to how technology tends to to emerge it wasn't there before we increment on our past learnings and and specifically there i'm going all we can do is some sly roundabout way to introduce something they can't stop and by they don't think they're not nobody's trying to hurt you it's just how if you if you were a central banker today what would you do you because the system would collapse if you if you raised interest rates systems collapse if you don't keep on and and so they're stuck um and that's what that's what and i'm not sure how many in in this room i actually should buy a show of hands how many people hold bitcoin not bad not bad um what i would recommend highly for anybody who doesn't get off zero like today um it is uh it's it it it we'll talk a little bit about it but but what is it uh it's an open decentralized network that it um that as people are voting for a new money essentially by stopping creative destruction at the at the economy level creative destruction moved to the monetary level that's what's happening and so you have you have a network that's expanding really fast that's that's lowering threshold cost that's open for anybody and no one can stop it it's impossible to stop and i'm sure there'll be some questions there but um and and what what i like about it forget i i don't need wealth a big bitcoin could go to zero for me that's actually not uh why i'm in it the but but if you think about this as a transition mechanism to get to the other side we know we're in a system that can't work and and and i like to think of business examples and in a company and most times in a company what a company does is drive them off the cliff by protecting the status quo and if you looked at what central bankers to today and all this entire globe it's driving off of cliff by protecting the status quo and what the greatest companies do is they put a research lab outside of the main company that does something different i think iphone blocked from the rest of the company nobody even knew it was it was it was there because it had to emerge without this thinking to be the new company and you need and and what i'd call that is you need to think of this as a network transfer people need to move to a system is if you measured your world in bitcoin you would see what i'm talking about you'll see deflation forever so people think about it as pricing going uh price is a bitcoin going up but the more important thing is everything is coming down in relation to bitcoin it's the most true sense of what the free market is looking like highly volatile it's still early very early in that cycle remember how volatile amazon was early in the cycle um and and and bitcoin right now is growing at the same rate as the internet and but it's growing at the same rate of the internet and and if you take an overlay of when 1998. google wasn't invented until 2000. um facebook not till 2008. most of the value came on the second layer a bitcoin of the internet and that's the similar thing that's happening happening here but more of more importantly it allows people to move from one system to another now i know that's really hard to grasp today with bitcoin and again but that's hard to grasp because you're projecting present bitcoin forward just like paul krugman in 1998 predicted present internet forward but a network effect that gets stronger and stronger as technology moves to that and gets better and better looks very different on the other side and that's what and that's what that looks like and it's emergent so it it actually does its job by redistributing power to everyone else and think about what technology does at its core technology in any company you have any business you have a monopoly the technology changes the rules to allow more people into the system it reduces friction cost and so so when you think about that in in in bitcoin specifically that's actually what it's it's doing and as people are joining that system it's actually making it stronger and stronger and stronger and it's so so so the number of people that will hold or defend or building towards that is staggering today and getting this some of the smartest minds around building this uh building this network and so again that prediction problem people are predicting what it is today forward instead of seeing what it's what it will turn turn into i'm going to end with this just before i open it up for questions but but ultimately you have this dilemma you have abundance and money which equals scarcity everywhere else and i'm specifically talking where we are moving with technology or scarcity and money which drives abundance everywhere else and with that i will turn it over to some questions we have a few minutes for questions as we get as we start i want to start with the first one jeff two quick questions they are not i mean firstly why bitcoin and and not gold um so uh and and and and could gold go up yes could could central banks kind of make it so today you have a world where with more and more mistrust largely caused by when you have misinformation and money you have misinformation everywhere and so people are trying and so countries through game theory and everything else i have the same how do i do trade with somebody i can't trust everything else and that's growing at an exponential rate because of the exponential rate of money printing and so could there be an environment where where a bunch of central banks get together and say okay we're going back to the gold standard i see it as highly unlikely but bigger reason there is this is the first time in history this innovation in bitcoin that you could actually remove that that problem because gold served for a lot of time as that uh as that stable currency or holding holding systems in check but what what always happened with gold because it had to be centralized it would always be captured and then repriced throughout time and so it requires somebody else deciding and that decision and again don't take yourself out of that decision process because i think a lot of you it would make the same decisions we we we think we we want everybody else to do one thing while we do another and so we would elect the same people and that decision it creates this this cascade of a credit-based system on top of it and that credit-based system on top of it must keep expanding and while you see these events through history unfold is because of the same thing and bitcoin is the only thing i've seen i've looked everything you can imagine if i'm talking here i've i've really done it's the only thing i've seen that actually has a chance to forever remove humans from the loop in a in a monetary system and i think that's actually a requirement because humans are not by history are not great people to put in control of something as important as money our our time we have sorry i would like to ask you to explore a little bit your thoughts regarding deflation you mentioned that credit will not work but as an everyday person i think technology and companies will be more efficient my salary will be worth more what what is the bad thing in deflation there's way less jobs it actually it actually happens by removing jobs that's why we that's why we use technology and the rate of job destruction is and if you allow that to fall at the natural rate so there's this thing in our brains that we they can't see the abundance because we've always lived in a different system the most valuable thing to everybody sitting in this room the most valuable today in everybody's life right now is the area you're breathing more important than water more important than anything else what is the oxygen in your breathing the area you're breathing so if it's the most valuable why isn't it the highest price and there we see the abundance creates free and we are in an escalating path to create free because there's no way you could build a company unless you're selling air underwater or in space to be able to sell air and it wouldn't unless where it's scarce and so we have one system wanting to create abundance everywhere and one system trying to stop it and the abundance comes from the job declines that actually save you the time you don't need all the jobs to keep up with the rate of price pricing because the technology does the job but you're driving people essentially you're creating modern day slavery by driving people to have to work harder and harder harder on an escalating wheel to keep up to prices that you're creating them to go up that's the that's the dilemma thank you thank you very much i hope you won't mind me observing that gold has been reinserted into the payment system in a decentralized way through an app called glint pay which people can find online i should say i'm a small investor in it but my question uh for you is what do you make of central bank digital currencies particularly in the context the great struggle that you've forecast ahead so so the it's a i wrote a medium piece this is the talk it's called the greatest game and i would encourage you to look it up because because it talks about that central bank digital currencies is actually a natural extension of what has to happen in a system that must keep going it's essentially saying that we can't do this from an independent central bank anymore we have to drive it into government which is going to be driven by people and we have to control everything we remove the banks from that process and we do direct direct transfers and you could look at that as central bank digital currencies as surveillance disguised as money that's a and so but that is where the world is going without bitcoin that is where the world is going it's actually that's why it's that important it's critically important and why will people do it because they'll get more for it that's why that's why this is so so our incentive structure kind of feeds back on itself why are people voting for socialism all over the world when it's a failed experiment all over the world because because if you were them and you couldn't pay your bills and everything's going up you're you're looking to the system to help you because you don't know we have a question there by the gentleman with the beer so thank you very much i mean politicians and economists are already for centuries of let's say 150 years obsessed with economic growth but the way we measure currently economic growth with gdp is through the price of the output so whenever there is a new good or new services that provides for needs in a cheaper way it is not captured in our measure of output and our measure of economic growth have you thought about how can we measure economic growth in such with deflationary technology or shall we give so pressuring it so so that's actually the entire point the entire point is when when we talk about productivity growth can can we actually look at our phones and say we haven't had product productivity growth can you actually look at your life and everything else look at the zoom what you're able to do all over the world um and say we haven't had productivity growth we don't have productivity growth because we're measuring it in a system that productivity growth is deflation because it doesn't require things turn into information information trends to free that productivity growth is deflation and we're we're capturing it and concentrating power as a result so you and then when i said we measure a system by the system and when a when a measure becomes a when a when a measure becomes a metric it ceases to be a good measure so we measure inflation we measure we measure gdp and everything else and it ceases to be it's not an output we're creating it artificially anthony hi jeff thank you very much um so as you mentioned people are voting socialism everywhere even though it's a failed system i think the the pandemic has proven that people are willing to tolerate all sorts of controls in their life and india building codes stop people from upgrading from shanty towns so i'm wondering if the thrust of your presentation is to say that ideas are not like starting changing people's minds and ideas is not what's going to reform our society but technology as long as people allow that to do so what is the relationship what what is that and thanks for the question i think that's actually we we don't realize how much we will ourselves change so today we're all sitting in this system measuring a system making the system stronger in fact even austrian economics has been marginalized because the system's getting stronger and stronger and stronger and people are so it's marginalized all over the place and it was it was built during a time of upheaval caused by similar similar transit transition people looking through to see how people act actions and everything else but as being marginalized through through this and and and saying no it should be australian economics on a system change it's just going to marginalize it further what ends up happening is you need a new that's actually what bitcoin is so if you kind of said it's a new technology that drastically opens the doors why people in el salvador nigeria all over the world are flocking why it's growing so fast is because people are entering it and and what here's a better way to way to look at it who were the first people on amazon or the first people to build to google i can tell you as a business i was the first bit one of the first companies to build to google why because i was blocked by the existing high cost infrastructure of tv radio and google gave it to me for free so i built there and it created a new monopoly because it empowered all those left behind who are the first people on on amazon's shelves not the people on walmart so technology technology displaces the incumbents by opening up by by reducing the power by reducing costs so much for people most blocked by the system so it is is it any surprise that el salvador would advocate for that system is it any surprise that all over the world you have this growing we don't see it because we live in a privileged society that hasn't had hyperinflation yet we haven't seen all these things it's coming but we live in in a bubble in our privilege we don't understand the negative externalities of that as a cost somewhere else and that privilege kind of pushes us not to see it or might just not see it but what ends up happening is in a different system we change we all change just like if i if if i had asked that question about this phone um 15 years ago people would have said no it needs more buttons and they wouldn't have seen it didn't just become a phone it became everything you're ai assistant it came became everything because we don't under again we predict forward or our past we don't predict on on the future and and that's so you need this a system change this is allowing you to do that it can't ha ultimately what i'm trying to get it apart we could yell at the clouds all day long in the existing system it can't change itself it's impossible okay please we have we have three probably final questions let's try to make it quick so we can fit them all please go ahead sure great presentation thank you very much um i'm just wondering what you think of the future of bitcoin as a usable currency um as opposed to a store of value for example because as far as i understand it uh it's not the processing power is not powerful enough to be able to match for example the current banking system so what do you think of that and are there any alternatives so so proof of work and the and the trade-off to be able to create something decentralized the world and in security so that it couldn't be taken is proof of work that which is also slow transaction fees on our slow transaction speeds ten minutes on it that is that is a a function of the system and it's the best best way to to keep that decentralized decentralized the innovation comes on the second layer so lightning network right now what what el salvador implemented his payment payment rails is way faster than visa network everything else and it reinforces to the primary layer every 10 minutes so you have so so what you have is it it doesn't have to be in the primary layer because you're otherwise you're trading security for speed so you you keep security in the primary layer and you build a secondary layer and that innovation and just starting now if you see the rate of growth of the lightning network payment mechanism around where you would be blown away it's a hockey stick growth so you have two network effects one is a store of value one is a payment mechanism that are reinforcing each other on this most of the most of what is to come is to come it's uh but but i see that emergent it's i think right now it'd be hard to stop we have two questions here it's in the front professor turk first and then you no no no first first professor thank you for the most interesting uh talk how big a problem is it um that it seems that a lot of the bitcoin is owned by a very small number of people so so i i love that you asked that question it's actually more and more spread out all the all the time but actually think about a system dynamic so a system dynamic where wealth doesn't equal power our existing system wealth equals power wealth in a bitcoin if if you if you try to control wealth doesn't equal control if you try to control through your wealth what that means is distributing your bitcoin to other people this it's a system change that we can can't even fathom because it's such a different system from from what it looks like today so by the very nature of of a system moving to a free market system system like this it changes that dynamic it it's the only way for the abundance of technology moving at this rate to be broadly transferred to society it's the only way without capture of i kind of think of it this way who is the person that you want control of all other people with artificial intelligence and robotics and who would stand up to that force once once it consolidates that's our choice one or one of those too one question currently we are dealing in a hybrid monetary system it's partly serving the economy but partly also serving the interest of the state and state elites and part of the depth is serb is helping surviving states how to ensure that bitcoin wouldn't use the state also to serving its own interest circulating for that or bennett like china does or trying to do so so again china china's banned it now five times um and look at the and would by the way and you have you have a different ideologue you have an ideologue that says centralized control over everybody else and through through force or free market and those are the ends of the spectre a spectrum where people make choices and everything else markets free those ideologues are competing right now and so i said a long time ago it's bitcoin china has to ban bitcoin because it defunds the state it defunds the entire ideologue but it doesn't matter because it because it also incentivizes you know what just happened by them shutting down all the bitcoin that you you know what they created for the u.s and countries that are inaudib around the world and they gave up an economic advantage a staggering economic advantage on a new medium it's like turning off the internet we have sorry what we have one final question and then remember we're going to lunch and you can you know harass during one hour so please go ahead can you hear me is the microphone on yeah thank you very much for your talk and uh it's certainly a very convincing argument that you present but i've got some doubts about the health of the industry to be honest so i've looked at some reports of some bitcoin miners of the publicly listed ones and i wasn't able to find one that makes money on mining they all make money on speculation and you've got you know those joke coins you've got shiba inu you've got a dogecoin and they perform like bitcoin don't you think that's a worrying sign thank you no um so so let me handle the first one for the the the incentive structure for uh bitcoin mining designed into reducing the the the payment out of it is designed to actually keep really small margins and and so in certain hype cyber in certain cycles they can make more but what happens is more people make money money on it more miners race in and arbitrage that and brings it back down so is this a natural market cycle that is actually built into the code built into the incentive structure everything else every other altcoin i kind of think about it this way of course if bitcoin went from zero to sixty five thousand dollars and somebody said oh i'm going to create dog coin and i'm gonna have a and i can create this better one then they can create a whole bunch of money for themselves it's it's the opposite of decentralization it's all of those other things are are an attempt to actually create centralization or to or to and not an attempt but they would i asked if if i simply said if if all my ethereum was on amazon servers majority of it is and and people with guns came into amazon and said turn off ethereum would people turn it off and there you have your answer whether it's decentralized or decentralized and so can people make money speculating and all these other things but typically what ends up happening in technology is you have to have a 10x advantage to be able to beat the incumbent and why because people close the gap incumbent tries to block you bitcoin has that 10x advantage and it's emerging now now you have a network effect that's that's growing and getting stronger and stronger and stronger i asked myself what could i i don't i wouldn't say it's impossible but i can't think of anything i certainly haven't seen anything that gives me a 10x on bitcoin jeff thank you very much we'll invite you all to have lunch and thank you thank you
