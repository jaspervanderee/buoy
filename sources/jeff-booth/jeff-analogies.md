# Jeff Booth's Analogies & Metaphors — Catalog

Jeff makes abstract concepts concrete through powerful analogies. This catalog organizes his metaphors by concept, showing the **full 2–4 sentence version** (not just the one-liner).

Use these when explaining complex Bitcoin/economic concepts to beginners.

## Exponential Technology

### Paper Folding → Exponential Growth

**Concept:** Humans can't grasp exponential patterns; we underestimate technology's acceleration

**Full version:**
> "If you fold a piece of paper on itself—a normal eight-and-a-half by eleven piece of paper—if you could continue folding it past seven folds and continue folding it for 50 times, how thick would that piece of paper be? The piece of paper would be from here to the sun. I've asked that question to tens of thousands of people in live audiences and 99.9% of the people guess about two inches. If 50% of people got the answer, the human condition would say, 'Okay, we understand exponential patterns.' But because nobody gets the answer, it says human beings are really bad at exponential patterns—yet we have an exponential pattern on Moore's Law and technology moving at that rate. Where are we on technology? We're on fold 33 moving to fold 34. That means everything in technology over the last 50 years likely doubles in the next two years."

**When to use:** Explaining why people underestimate Bitcoin adoption, Lightning growth, or AI's deflation impact

---

### iPhone vs. Blackberry → Paradigm Shifts

**Concept:** Breakthrough innovations aren't improvements—they're new categories that destroy the old

**Full version:**
> "Apple's iPhone didn't copy Research in Motion's Blackberry design of needing a keyboard or selling to businesses who required RIM's security. It created a digital interface when that wasn't 'needed' and created an entirely new platform that changed the industry. Along the way, the Blackberry died, unable to compete with the value for users that was now increasing exponentially on Apple's platform."

**When to use:** Explaining why Bitcoin isn't "better money"—it's a new category (energy-backed protocol)

---

### Kodak's Digital Camera → Incumbents Trapped

**Concept:** Monopolies invent their own disruption but can't act on it

**Full version:**
> "Kodak was destroyed by the very digital camera that Kodak created. They invented the digital camera. Today all of that is gone, yet we have an abundance in photography. That abundance is free. We take more photos, all the editing software is available on our phones. We have unlimited photos. Where does that show up in positive GDP? That productivity is actually negative GDP."

**When to use:** Explaining why banks/governments can't adopt Bitcoin even if they understand it

---

## Energy & Bitcoin Mining

### Bakery + Always-On Buyer → Energy Markets

**Concept:** Bitcoin mining creates abundant energy by guaranteeing a buyer of excess production

**Full version:**
> "If you had a bakery, and I came in one day and said 'Listen, I'll buy everything that you produce extra that you don't sell,' next day you produce two times as much. I come in, I wanted a discount but I buy it all. Next day you produce four times as much. I buy it all. Next day you just say 'I'm going to buy more ovens, hire more people to produce unlimited bread.' I come in and I buy it all. What do we just do? By having an always-on buyer at the margin, we just created abundant bread. Insert energy for bread—that's all a Bitcoin miner is. You have an always-on buyer who will always buy at a lower price, and you're chasing global energy. You're overbuilding capacity anywhere because you always have a buyer."

**When to use:** Explaining how Bitcoin mining incentivizes energy abundance (not scarcity)

---

### Force-Field of Energy → Security

**Concept:** Proof of Work creates a physical barrier around past transactions

**Full version (via Gigi):**
> "By attaching energy to a block, we give it 'form,' allowing it to have real weight and consequences in the physical world. If we remove this energy, let's say by moving from miners to signers, we reintroduce trusted third parties into the equation, which removes the tie to physical reality that makes the past self-evident. It is this energy, this weight, that protects the public ledger. By bringing this unlikely information into existence, miners create a transparent force-field around past transactions, securing everyone's value in the process—including their own—without any use of private information."

**When to use:** Explaining why Proof of Work (energy) is essential to Bitcoin's security

---

## Wealth Extraction & Inequality

### Monopoly Game → Wealth Concentration

**Concept:** Small early advantages compound into complete dominance through system reinforcement

**Full version:**
> "If you go around a game board on Monopoly and you play with four friends, and you are fortunate enough to land on the right things the first three times around the board, you go around it pretty quickly. You gain an upper hand over others who landed on 'go to jail,' landed on 'free parking.' Just because of the luck of the roll of the dice, you gained an advantage that reinforces on itself as you put more houses on the properties. Your advantage reinforces itself and their disadvantage reinforces on themselves. You have two systems reinforcing, and you go around the game until somebody has no more money or somebody has all the money."

**When to use:** Explaining how inflation concentrates wealth; why the rich get richer

---

### The Victim → Self-Fulfilling Belief Systems

**Concept:** Your worldview creates your reality; the system is a mirror of your beliefs

**Full version:**
> "If I walked down the street with somebody who showed up as a victim, everything always happens to that person. Why? Because we're in search of belonging and love, and love is all around us all the time. But the victim doesn't realize that. To get love and belonging they show up as a victim, and as everybody moves further away, they double down on more drama to try to get people to come back. What they don't realize is the world is a complete reflection of their beliefs, and love and belonging was all around them all the time, but they're pushing it away with a sign on their forehead trying to get it."

**When to use:** Explaining personal accountability; why "it's not them—it's us"

---

## The Credit System

### Debt = Money → Ponzi Structure

**Concept:** The monetary system itself is a Ponzi that requires perpetual growth

**Full version:**
> "Banks create money as loans. If loans shrink, so does the money supply. If everyone paid back their debts, there would be no money. Since every dollar is created with a debt attached to it, if everyone paid back all their debts, there would be no money to pay back the debt. That's the problem. Every single thing that you think is of value would be zero—your bank would fail, all the stores you shop in would fail, the government would fail. Everything would fail as humans went back to a barter-type system. And so you won't let that system fail."

**When to use:** Explaining why central banks *must* print; why deflation is "impossible" in fiat

---

### Rearranging Deck Chairs on the Titanic → Futile Solutions

**Concept:** Policy "fixes" don't address the structural problem—they delay the inevitable

**Full version:**
> "Negative interest rates, modern monetary policy, printing money—it doesn't matter what you name it or what form it takes, all of these solutions keep the party going by driving more debt. It juices the economy in the short term while pushing more pain in the longer term. I call this the kick-the-can-down-the-road strategy—or rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic."

**When to use:** Explaining why austerity, MMT, UBI, etc., all fail to solve the root problem

---

## Bitcoin Concepts

### Cyber Hornets → Decentralized Innovation Swarm

**Concept:** When you attack Bitcoin, you activate distributed defenders and builders

**Full version (paraphrased, H/T Michael Saylor):**
> "Should governments attempt to stop Bitcoin in a coordinated fashion, technological innovation will move beyond Bitcoin's utility as a store of value rapidly. A swarm of 'cyber-hornets' will rush in to drive the technology forward. The more they try to stop it, the more they encourage it—it's a marketing ploy."

**When to use:** Explaining Bitcoin's antifragility; why attacks make it stronger

---

### Two Different Realities → Observer Effect

**Concept:** Measuring from fiat vs. Bitcoin shows two opposite truths—both valid from their frame

**Full version:**
> "We're walking down the street—we would see two different realities. My reality would be totally true for me, and I would see abundance, love, opportunities everywhere. That person wouldn't. I didn't say mine was right and theirs wasn't right—they're both right, they're both true, they're just different. We live in a construct of those different ideas across space and time of each individual person. If you measure Bitcoin from your debasing currency, it appears like Bitcoin is going up. But that says nothing about Bitcoin. It says about your perception of Bitcoin. From Bitcoin, the honest energy-based protocol, your house is falling in value. Energy is falling. Everything is falling—like it should—in a free market."

**When to use:** Teaching users to price in sats; explaining why "Bitcoin goes up" is the wrong frame

---

### Bitcoin Doesn't Care → Protocol Indifference

**Concept:** Bitcoin imposes reality whether you accept it or not—like gravity

**Full version:**
> "I realized Bitcoin actually didn't care what I thought of it. Every ten minutes there was a new block. It didn't care. It never cared what I thought. A lot of people care what it does, but it was imposing this new reality whether I cared or not. It doesn't say anything about Bitcoin if I want to give my energy to the system based on theft. It says something about me."

**When to use:** Explaining Bitcoin's neutrality; why adoption is inevitable regardless of opinion

---

## Transition & Choice

### Two Doors → Dystopian vs. Abundant Future

**Concept:** Humanity faces a binary choice between totalitarian control and decentralized abundance

**Full version:**
> "There are two paths. Path one: we continue with central control of everything, which looks like totalitarianism—a horrific human future where a small number of people control everything with artificial intelligence and robotics. Path two: we transition to a digitally native currency that allows for deflection, so the abundance gained from technology's progress is broadly shared. You must—if you don't want door one (totalitarianism) or door two (war/reset)—have a digitally native currency that allows the free market to work."

**When to use:** Framing Bitcoin as humanity's "exit"; explaining the stakes

---

### Light Switch for You (Not the World) → Individual Sovereignty

**Concept:** The transition will be chaotic globally, but you can flip your personal switch today

**Full version:**
> "This isn't a light switch for the world—this is going to happen for a long time and it's going to be chaotic on both sides. But it can be a light switch for you. Each individual—you live in a time where you could move to the honest network and no one can stop you. If you're spending 2% of your time there, spend 4%. If you're spending 4%, spend 8%. Every time you move more time to the honest network, you will be rewarded more."

**When to use:** Empowering users to act now without waiting for mass adoption

---

## Broader Concepts

### Information → Free → Abundance

**Concept:** Everything that becomes information trends toward zero cost; abundance replaces scarcity

**Full version:**
> "Things become information, information becomes free, and everything is becoming information. Use an example of a chair: What is a chair? It's information—somebody's mind had an idea for a chair. That design must work in the market to provide value. Within 10 years, that information will move into a digital printer and you'll print your chair in your region. The next step: your idea is embedded with AI, and you have unlimited designs of chairs that can be produced instantaneously for almost free. We're going from a system where we print nothing but too much money to a system where we can print everything but no money."

**When to use:** Explaining deflation as natural; why scarcity-based economics is obsolete

---

### Mirror of Your Beliefs → Reality as Reflection

**Concept:** The world you see is literally a mirror reflection of your belief system

**Full version:**
> "The world you see is literally a mirror reflection of your beliefs. That world comes into effect from those same beliefs, but we think it's somebody else. If that's true with everyone else, it must happen to me too. You take credit for the things that are good in your life and blame where it's not. If you just were really honest and said 'It's all me,' you would find the things in you that were stopping you."

**When to use:** Teaching personal accountability; shifting from blame to agency

---

## When to Use Analogies (Guidelines)

### Good use cases:
- **Beginners** who need a mental model
- **Complex mechanisms** (credit system, mining incentives)
- **Counterintuitive concepts** (deflation is good, energy use is a feature)
- **Showing inevitability** (exponential patterns, system collapse)

### Poor use cases:
- **Advanced users** who already get it (they'll find it patronizing)
- **Quick reference** (analogies take space—use for teaching, not documenting)
- **When precision matters** (legal, technical specs)

## How to Adapt Jeff's Analogies

1. **Keep the structure:** Setup (2 sentences) → Expansion (2 sentences) → Connection (1 sentence)
2. **Don't rush:** Let the reader "see" the bakery, the Monopoly game, the paper folding
3. **Use familiar examples:** Everyone knows Monopoly, iPhones, bakeries
4. **Connect explicitly:** "That's exactly what's happening with Bitcoin mining"
5. **One analogy per concept:** Don't stack analogies—it confuses

---

**Next Steps:**
- When writing service pages, pick ONE analogy from this catalog to explain a key concept
- Use the "full version" format—don't abbreviate
- Test with a non-Bitcoiner to see if it clicks
- Add new analogies here as you discover them in future Jeff content
