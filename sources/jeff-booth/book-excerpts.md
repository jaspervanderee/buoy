How the Economy Works,

Part I: Printing Money




			I 	had dinner recently with Chen Fong, a friend of mine from the Creative Destruction Lab, where we mentor, invest, and advise numerous technology startups. He is also a professor emeritus at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Calgary, cofounder of Calgary Scientific, and a member of the Order of Canada. In addition to the fifty or so companies that Chen mentors and invests in, he still finds the time to sit on six charitable boards. To say the least, it was a very engaging evening with a deep thinker. During dinner and after a few glasses of wine, the talk turned to rising inequality around the world. Chen shared a story with me about his in-laws.

			It was shortly after the 2008 financial crisis. Chen had no reason to expect his in-laws were worried. They were in their eighties and they were financially secure. The crash had not hurt their lifestyle. But they watched the response to the crisis from governments around the world, and they remembered what they had seen before. He asked them why they were worried. Their answer stayed with him:

			“First currency wars, then trade wars, then real wars.”

			Perhaps what Chen’s parents-in-law saw was the repeat of a scenario that gave rise to extremism, political upheaval, and ultimately a world war about eighty years ago. That scenario was rising inequality and a loss of hope in large segments of a population, which allowed new politicians to use that wedge to polarize, driving protectionism and nationalism.





What the experts got wrong


			We know that 2008 wasn’t any garden variety economic down-turn. It also wasn’t one that most of the economic establishment saw coming. The experts expected the world to continue in the manner in which they were accustomed until they were well past the edge of the cliff:

			One of the few economists to correctly forecast what was happening at the time was Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University. In 2006, two years before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rescue of the financial system, Roubini “stood before an audience of economists at the International Monetary Fund and announced that a crisis was brewing.”

			In the coming months and years, he warned, the United States was likely to face a once-in-a-lifetime housing bust, an oil shock, sharply declining consumer confidence and, ultimately, a deep recession. He laid out a bleak sequence of events: homeowners defaulting on mortgages, trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities unraveling worldwide, and the global financial system shuddering to a halt. These developments, he went on, could cripple or destroy hedge funds, investment banks, and other major financial institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.5

			To be fair, Roubini had missed recession calls in the past. But he was right about this one. Years of loose credit coupled with financial engineering wizardry created an unprecedented bubble in housing in the United States. When housing started to unwind, the interconnections that caused the run-up unwound as well. Those interconnections were global in nature and risked taking down the entire economic system.

			It wasn’t housing itself that caused the 2008 bubble. If it hadn’t been housing, it would have been somewhere else that easy credit was flowing to. The continuing rise of debt that cannot be paid back was at the heart of the housing crises and will be at the heart of the next crisis. A bubble pops when people wake up and realize that the debt can never be paid off. At that point, credit is removed—and because easy credit was the main thing causing the run-up, assets collapse. It is what led to the bubble in technology stocks in early 2000s. It is what led to the crisis in Greece and to the crisis in Venezuela today.

			Many people believe that the system is much safer now. That we have safeguards with financial controls to protect against a collapse like 2008. That the cause is well understood—low-income loans to housing and toxic assets tied to it. If you believe that, take another look at the timeline above to see what the experts were saying in the run-up to that crisis. While housing itself might be safer, the system is not.

			With credit continuing to advance globally, it is only a shell game as to where the next crisis originates. In fact, the shell game is now moving to currencies themselves and the entire economic system that is built on top of them.

			A financial system based on credit is just an exchange of money today for money later. I give you dollars today and temporarily lose the utility of my money in exchange for having more later. You have the inverse: the benefit of more money today and less tomorrow as you pay back the loan with interest.

			This system works on trust—trust that you will pay what you said you would pay. It is the same whether that trust is in a person, company, or government. Remove trust and it affects the credit-worthiness of an individual or company. Remove trust from a system and the entire system can unravel very quickly.





The world in balance


			World economies could be viewed as one large economy, driven by trust, interconnection, movement of money, and debt. That means that no single country’s gross domestic product (GDP) can be considered in isolation.

			There are four components that make up GDP:6

			Consumer spending or personal consumption (C)

			Investments (I)

			Net exports (X)

			Government spending (G)



			The mathematical formula to calculate the components of GDP (Y) is simple: Y = C + I + X + G. GDP comes down to the interplay of those four components. Countries rely primarily on different levers because the inputs compete against each other. GDP tells you how each country is managing the four inputs together. As a by-product of that, it also tells you what a government values more to drive their economy and jobs. Higher-income countries typically rely on consumer spending as a primary driver of GDP growth, while lower-income countries are more likely to depend on net exports. These inputs compete against each other: for example, in countries with higher incomes, consumer spending naturally increases, but because their jobs pay more, their exports to other countries are disadvantaged by being more expensive.

			This also means that when politicians talk of trade surpluses or deficits with their trading partners while only understanding one part of the equation, it’s complete nonsense. Mathematically, the world’s trade balance must be zero: for every buyer, there needs to be a seller, and for every seller, there needs to be a buyer.

			Let’s look at the trade relationship between the United States and China as an example. China runs a trade deficit with the United States, meaning that the United States imports more from China than it exports. Many, including the current president of the US, claim this is unfair.

			Here is how the balance between the two countries actually works out. Almost 70 percent of the United States’ GDP is made up of consumer spending; in China, consumer spending makes up only about 30 percent of GDP. In China, incentivizing production requires keeping lower wages (relative to the world), tax incentives for production and distribution, and investments in automation to achieve production that allows their exports to win on a world market. Conversely, to support consumer spending at 70 percent of the economy, the United States requires relatively higher wages, high credit creation with low interest rates (debt to finance that increased spending), and lower taxes. Donald Trump’s tax incentives enacted November 2, 2017, had an effect of 1) increasing consumer spending and growth in the economy—in other words, I will give you more money, so you spend it, driving short-term growth in GDP and jobs; this 2) increased the trade deficit with China as consumers bought more imported products, and it also 3) increased the US budget deficit in 2018 to almost $800 billion. Over ten years, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax cuts alone will add an additional $2.28 trillion of national debt to the US.

			So each country is maintaining policies that incentivize its side of the equation with government help. If any of those variables changes too quickly in either economy, chaos ensues as the major part of their respective economies collapse.

			Understanding this balance and making informed decisions is important because we all live in the same world; each side of a relationship affects the other. A growing consumer class in China could very well help lift world economies, but for that to happen, Chinese workers will need to be paid more. And if American workers want to sell to China, they’ll have to earn less. I’m sure that many people in the US who are frustrated with China’s role as producer would not accept the 996 work weeks (9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days per week) for average wages of $1,400 per month that many of their Chinese counterparts have.

			This same balance is seen around the world. When the European Union adopted a common currency, the euro gave increased purchasing power to Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and others that previously had lower valued currencies. People in Greece, for example, were able to buy more from Germany, which is the third-largest exporter in the world. German banks were happy to fund loans to Greece, and both countries grew their GDP quickly—one because of exports, and the other because of consumer spending. German banks were giving Greece German money to buy from Germany, with the expectation that Germany would later get even more money back—which Greece would have to come up with somehow. When it was realized that Greece might not be able to pay back the money, Greece was forced into a crisis. Had Greece walked away from the loans, it wasn’t only Greece that would suffer. The German banks underwriting the loans would have to write them off, causing Germany’s economy to slow.

			This is also happening between China and the US, and not in the way you might think. China has been buying US government debt as a consequence of trade. It now has more than $1.1 trillion of US reserves and tops the global list of US Treasury bond holders. As with Germany lending money to Greece, this can be looked at as vendor financing, such as you might get from a car dealer: I provide you cheap capital so that you purchase my goods, and I make more in the long run. It also helps to ensure a US market for China’s exports by keeping interest rates low, so that consumers spend more. But China cannot reasonably stop buying government bonds without collapsing its own economy, because then interest rates would move much higher in the US and cripple consumer spending, which would then collapse China’s economy. It’s a feedback loop in interconnected economies.

			And without continued debt-fuelled spending, it would be like sticking a pin in a balloon, because growth would collapse and we would suddenly see what has been there all along. The natural trend of technology deflation.

			When economies and high-paying jobs are at risk, though, the easiest thing to do in politics is to blame outsiders or game the situation to provide short-term benefit—and kick the can down the road. This ignores the impact of technological growth and only serves to create more global tension. Bringing back coal mining jobs at a time when hydrocarbons are being replaced by renewable energy is akin to training more blacksmiths when the horse and buggy was being replaced by the automobile. It doesn’t address the root cause for the jobs disappearing: technology. It also doesn’t allow focus on the most important jobs or things that must be done to enable the future.

			Looking outward for blame also ignores decades of government policy that has seen most countries’ government debt far too high already, continuing to grow much faster than their economies, setting up an untenable situation where servicing the debt is an increasing drag on the economies—and will ultimately become impossible.





The Ponzi economy


			In his book Between Debt and the Devil, Adair Turner, the former chair of the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, which regulated the financial services industry, takes readers down the path of unfettered borrowing by companies and individuals who are financing that borrowing not by creating more goods and services, but by relying on the price inflation of the assets they already have. This, in turn, fuels asset price inflation, people pile on more debt, and, like hamsters on a wheel, they keep going and going around until they fly off or collapse.

			When debt is growing much faster than a country’s economy, at what point does the music stop? It is often difficult to see, because asset price inflation can make individuals, companies, and even countries feel much better off than they are. In the run-up to 2008, the economy seemed very strong as individuals in the United States used the newfound gain in their home’s asset value to take loans for cars, boats, and vacations. But when the asset (in this case, the home) falls in value, the debt still needs to be paid. We fool ourselves into believing that assets, such as stocks or housing, always go up over the long term because they always have. We should ask whether those same assets would have gone up over the last twenty years if there hadn’t been $185 trillion of new capital injected into economies over that time. When that stops, which it eventually will, things will change very quickly.

			If it takes ever-increasing credit growth to achieve economic growth, how are our economies any different from a Ponzi scheme? A Ponzi scheme creates an illusion of profits because it pays early investors with investments from later investors. Even though the scheme is a fraud, it can look like a good business in that early investors talk about how great their returns are. Because it requires more and more capital to pay out investors, it continues until new investors at the bottom of the pyramid slow down enough to stop paying out earlier investors, which brings the entire system down. At what point does debt slow enough to bring the entire system down? When does the future stop paying off the past?

			To keep the system running, monetary policy all around the world has target inflation rates. From a debt perspective, this makes sense: inflation makes debt easier to pay back because you’re paying yesterday, when dollars cost more, with money from tomorrow, when dollars are worth less. In the United States in 1970, a $3.25 per hour wage had the same purchasing power as a $25.00 per hour job today. A movie ticket that cost $1.55 in 1970 is more than $9.00 today. A gallon of gasoline in 1970 was 36 cents; it’s $2.98 today. A debt that you took on then that cost you 100 hours of work—$325—could be paid off with 13 hours of work today. Even with interest, you can come out ahead.

			For those unable to access debt, though, and put it into assets that rose in value, the inflation has been punishing because their dollars do not go as far as they used to.

			And since inflation makes your currency worth less over time, we need to start asking: Isn’t currency founded on trust in the value of that currency? And doesn’t that mean that by setting inflation target rates, governments have a stated goal of eroding that trust?





Cheap money


			What can we do about this? Let’s look at the 2008 crisis to help understand what can happen.

			In an interconnected economy driven by credit and ever more debt, there are no easy choices. Once housing prices had collapsed, governments could 1) bail out the banks and the risk takers, and create moral hazard in doing so, or 2) risk a worldwide depression as trust in the financial system broke down and markets stopped. They chose door number one: bail out the banks and risk takers and create moral hazard in doing so.

			We have no way of truly knowing how wide and lasting the damage would have been had the governments and central banks of the world not stepped in with massive support to save the economic system. We can play armchair quarterback now, but policy makers at the time were dealing with real-time changes and without all of the facts in an interconnected global economy that could have ground to a halt causing much more damage than we can imagine. They knew every decision would be put under a microscope and questioned for generations.

			That said, they made a choice that changed capitalism by gifting many of the engineers of the chaos with risk-free returns at the taxpayers’ expense. Using quantitative easing in the United States and other monetary easing around the world, central banks and governments decided who won and who lost. And it is the second- and third-order effects of that decision that are sowing the seeds of discontent around the world.

			Quantitative easing refers to the act of injecting liquidity into an economy by a central bank. In order to inject liquidity, new dollars need to be created and they need to be delivered into the economy. Many people refer to the first part as “printing new money,” though the money does not actually need to be printed—it can just be given as balance sheet credits by a central bank. For instance, the US Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has expanded from just under $900 billion in 2008 to approximately $4 trillion today.

			The second part, delivering the newly created money into the economy, is done in a variety of ways, such as large-scale asset purchases from public and private sectors like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, where the government buys toxic or underperforming assets. By doing so, governments take bad assets off the balance sheets of corporations and give them fresh new capital instead.

			Another way to get new money into the system is through directly issuing loans to commercial banks. In the United States in 2008, banks were given access to borrow federal funds at a 0 percent interest rate. The banks could then lend out those dollars at higher interest rates to rebuild their damaged balance sheets over time. Some non-banks at the time, like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, changed their charters to become banks to get access to the free money as well. Without this opportunity, many of the banks and investments banks would have merged, been bought at pennies on the dollar, or collapsed outright.

			By nature, though, quantitative easing also causes currency devaluation, even if that’s not what it’s specifically intended to do. The government doesn’t actually have more assets; it’s just representing its assets with more units of currency, which means each unit of currency is worth less—like cutting a pizza into twelve slices instead of eight, or dividing an estate between ten heirs rather than nine. Immediately following the announcement of the first round of quantitative easing, the US dollar lost value, and other currencies where easing was prominent also fell and remained in equilibrium to the US dollar. As a result, if you were a holder of US dollars or cash, you lost value. If you were paid in US dollars, your pay was worth less—although you probably didn’t notice it until your fuel prices went up in relation to your paycheque. As the US currency became weaker, asset prices around the world rose in lockstep.

			Oil prices are a good example to demonstrate this, because oil is an asset with limited supply. If a country’s currency loses value and the country needs to import oil, it needs to use more of that currency to buy the same amount of oil. Through three rounds of quantitative easing in the United States, oil prices rose from $30 a barrel to more than $100. Countries with strong natural resource sectors that are in limited supply saw their currencies’ value rise in tandem with the easing in the United States. For example, in my own country, Canada, natural resources are abundant; oil, gold, lumber, and other commodities are major drivers of the economy. The Canadian dollar, which typically trades at around 75 cents to the US dollar, rose to almost a record high versus the US dollar after 2008. Other countries with large natural resource sectors—like Brazil, Russia, and Saudi Arabia—also saw their currencies rise. And along with that, their own labour rates also rose relative to the US.

			There is a close connection between currency value and labour rate—how much workers are paid. A country that devalues its currency also indirectly lowers its labour rate against global competitors, which can help some job growth in the short term, because its goods cost less to buyers in other countries. For example, if the Thai baht goes down in value compared to the US dollar and Thai workers are still paid the same, goods that Thailand produces cost US customers less, which can help jobs in Thailand in the short term because more US customers will buy those goods. But the costs for Thai workers for all imported goods they need to buy may go up in direct proportion to the currency devaluation.

			Countries often devalue currency to help their export markets. But in a globally connected world with many countries driving each of their own national interests and jobs, this makes less sense. Other countries trying to compete for the same scarce jobs devalue their currencies to keep their economies from collapsing. This race to the bottom on currencies only serves to further push up global asset prices. And the endless game of reducing the value of currencies relative to others only serves as a short-term panacea, because asset prices will rise far more quickly than jobs can be created—and pay rates increased—to keep pace with the asset price rise.

			As the economist John Maynard Keynes wrote,

			Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their desserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become “profiteers,” who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.7





Changing the rules


			When governments are unable to substantively change the rules of the game or gain leverage because other countries are forced to devalue in response to keep their jobs, the next step—as foretold by Chen’s parents-in-law—is tariffs and trade wars.

			Many politicians around the world are gaining power on promises of closing borders, including Donald Trump, who was elected on a protectionist America-first platform. He also promised to erase a trade deficit with China, only to see it continue to rise to its highest level. And a favourite weapon in his arsenal is tariffs.

			Could tariffs help?

			The last time tariffs were enacted in a major way in the United States, it didn’t end well. In the 1930s, the US had a similar goal as many countries have today. An unwind of credit expansion around the world created the Great Depression. To protect American farming jobs from foreign competition, the US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, named after the congressmen who conceived it. That act raised tariffs to protect jobs but dramatically underestimated the reaction from other countries in doing so. They were foolish to believe that they could keep their existing exports while protecting their own economy from imports. The resulting trade wars, with Canada and Europe retaliating and increasing tariffs on US goods, are widely understood to have prolonged the Great Depression and made it worse for the very farmers that the tariff act was supposed to protect.

			We see the same thing happening around the world today as each country retaliates in its own way. Our economies and countries are interconnected, as are our people. No country works in isolation.

			Is there any other option?

			Let’s imagine for a moment a world where the central bankers decided to let the banks fail, something that many say should have been the right course—capitalism actually calls for such a cleansing. At the end of 2008, there are no bailouts. No quantitative easing. It’s not a difficult thought experiment.

			Asset prices collapse. Loans on those assets become non-performing. Most of the banking system collapses. Only the best loans can be repaid. Many people are wiped out as the collapse destroys all who took unnecessary risks. Some of those are you and me and pensioners, people who misunderstood the risk we were taking with some of the exotic investments that we were told were safe. As well, many more are wiped out because of the lack of liquidity in the system, meaning that some investments deemed safe also fail. This result might produce a depression so severe it would make the Great Depression look like a walk in the park. But in that environment, hard dollars would explode in value and those who had savings and cash would pick up extremely low-priced assets and mispriced deals and make their fortunes.

			Imagine how different your life could look. Real estate would not be priced anywhere near where it is today. Stocks would likely still be near historic lows. Our politicians would look different—in fact, some of them wouldn’t be our politicians, because they would have been wiped out with their debt and the asset price collapse.

			Monetary easing and artificially low interest rates have been a grand experiment played out on the world stage without full consideration of the downstream effects. For the wealthy and those with assets that have been artificially boosted, that experiment has played out well. If we’re being honest with ourselves, much of the wealth and privilege that we enjoy is not from our ingenuity or hard work, but because the governments of the world decided to print money. Our assets, including real estate and stocks, were the beneficiaries, having run up in value far beyond what they would have been without the printing.

			Meanwhile, those without assets find themselves on a treadmill that is moving ever faster—and unable to keep up.

			It’s like we’re living in Bizarro World where everything is backwards. Bizarro—a comic created by Dan Piraro—takes place not on a spherical Earth but on a cube-shaped Htrae (Earth spelled backwards). In one Bizarro strip from April 1961, a salesman is doing a brisk trade selling Bizarro bonds that are “guaranteed to lose money for you.” That’s not even a joke today. In many parts of the world, banks have negative rates: money retains more value stored under your mattress than in a bank.

			So, as the market celebrates ever more stimulation from governments and stocks and housing continue to rise higher, the market should also “celebrate” the dislocation of our societies. As Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in 2018, “The central issue is we’re developing into a plutocracy. We’ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they’re rich because they’re smart and constructive.”8

			I grew up in a world where I believed anything was possible, and that hard work and ingenuity were rewarded. I still believe that. I also believe in capitalism, where risk is rewarded and punished, and where the free market is the ultimate referee of your value. That is why it pains me so much to see it breaking down. A market where government reaches in to decide who wins or loses is nothing more than crony capitalism, where wealth is not created by the value you create and the risks you take to get there but by a political system that rewards its insiders.

			And for every person on the winning side of that decision, there are many others on the losing side. Their costs of food, shelter, gas, and healthcare are rising because their cash and wages are less valuable. Assets that they don’t yet own are running away in price. They are feeling the squeeze of an unjust system.

			Just like you, they might be unaware of how much was given to you in this exchange, and just like you, they are equally unaware of how much was taken from them. But they do know that something doesn’t feel right—and they are fed up.





How the Economy Works, Part II: Creative Destruction




			The biggest problem with all of the solutions we’re trying today is that the inflationary environment that we have counted on for growth is breaking down because of technology. No tariffs, manipulation of currencies, or debt escalation will solve that problem. And as our economies move into the digital age where technology and data underlie everything, they don’t just deflate, they also become increasingly interconnected. Information doesn’t have the same constraints that physical goods have: it travels seamlessly across borders. It is much more efficient, eradicating a lot of waste from the system. But much of that waste and inefficiency are our jobs.

			We have been told this before—only to prosper as technology and innovation transitioned some jobs but, overall, had a positive long-term impact on jobs and economies. In the 1800s, machines replaced much of the hard labour that came before them and society was enriched. That technology created more new jobs than it destroyed, and the luddites who feared that it would be the end of work were proven wrong. Or, maybe, they were just early.

			Around the world, tensions are rising because prices are rising and high-paying jobs are at risk. A 2019 Pew Research Center study confirms the mood. Only 14 percent of US adults say that by the year 2050, the average working person in the US will have more job security.9

			Because of this tension and fear, people are losing empathy and following xenophobic ideologues, and we are collectively missing the most important point: it is our inflationary system, which requires ever more jobs, that needs to be changed.





Out with the old, in with the new


			One of the pillars of capitalism is a free-market system—it’s the centrepiece of how all modern economies evolve—a near-constant flow of innovative entrepreneurs breaking monopolies and then themselves creating new ones. The paradoxical term “creative destruction” was coined for this by Austrian American economist Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950). In Schumpeter’s vision of capitalism, innovation by entrepreneurs was the disruptive force that sustained economic growth, even though it destroyed the value of established companies. Furthermore, the value that was destroyed in established companies was that which they enjoyed from some level of monopoly power derived from a previous technological, regulatory, organizational, or economic paradigm.

			New technologies often change what is valuable in a way that is misunderstood by incumbents who have spent years perfecting their own playbook to win markets. Even if the pattern is well understood, the incumbent can be disadvantaged: technology often changes where business value is derived from and, in doing so, can reduce the worth of the incumbent’s assets at the same time as the market is shifting. It is those very assets, once highly valued and sometimes highly leveraged, that themselves become the proverbial noose around the neck.

			Chris Anderson, former editor of The Economist and author of The Long Tail, hints at some of the changes. In his book, he explains how when distribution costs fall, large incumbents that rely on their power to control distribution are at risk. For example, prior to Google, distribution of information required a different, less scalable infrastructure, and power came from controlling distribution. Whether that distribution was in the form of a newspaper with its physical infrastructure, a network on television, or a large marketing budget that crowded others out, controlling distribution was paramount and expensive. Digital delivery changed the rules. Information could travel much further and faster, and, as a result, it reduced the value of traditional distribution power.

			Blockbuster, at the height of its popularity, had more than 84,000 employees and more than 9,000 stores. Its advantage was built around a physical distribution strategy that had its stores located close to customers. It used the power of its scale to have more hits in stock and to negotiate with content producers. But Blockbuster didn’t see the rate of technology advancement and consequently failed to see a world where digital delivery was instantaneous and free (or almost free)—a world where consumers wouldn’t walk in its doors and plonk down two or three bucks to borrow a video and then pay late fees because they forgot to drive back to the store and return it on time.

			It seems easy to see now, but at the time that executives were making these decisions, download speeds made streaming impossible and Netflix relied on the physical delivery of DVDs. Unable to grasp how fast technology was moving, it was easy for them to be complacent. By the time they could see what was coming, it was too late. They were playing a game they couldn’t win. Blockbuster’s main competitive advantage that drove business value for years prior—having 9,000 stores, with the attendant costs—became its disadvantage almost overnight. The most innovative thing they could do was add candy aisles to their stores. The extra revenue only delayed the inevitable: revenues went up in the short term, only to fall off the cliff the next year.

			Did Blockbuster have bad management? No. They were trapped in existing frameworks. Even if they had known what was coming and could solve it, their existing business model didn’t give them any advantage in the new market. The cost to keep the old business going and pivot to a new business would have been extraordinarily high. Netflix created; Blockbuster was destroyed.

			I know what it must have looked like from both sides. I’ve been there: leading a company with a business model that worked for a while, but then realizing that a transition was necessary to preserve the future.





A Call to Action




			Every company that was designed to have success in 	the twentieth century is designed to fail in the twenty-	first century.”

			Salim Ismail, author of Exponential Organizations, said that to an audience of the Young Presidents’ Organization members at a conference that I organized. Ismail understands exponential technologies and helps businesses build a framework for implementing them. Ismail didn’t say that the older institutions necessarily would fail. But he told us that it is a rare exception in history when a monopoly company of the past does what is necessary to stay relevant in the future.

			I thought of all of the examples of companies current and past who couldn’t or didn’t make the transition. The average thirty-three-year tenure of companies on the S&P 500 list is forecasted to shrink to just twelve years by 2027 due to technology. It makes sense—transition requires long-term thinking. It requires going against the grain of where the current market and profits are. Bets on the future are invariably big bets against where the market is today. To make that bet in light of what investors and stakeholders want you to do to satisfy their immediate short-term needs requires bold leadership and time.

			We have looked at many examples of companies that didn’t make the right bet, including Kodak, Blockbuster, and Sears. Microsoft might prove to be an example of a success in transition, but for every Microsoft, there is a graveyard of companies that couldn’t or wouldn’t make the transition. Ironically, one of the reasons Microsoft was able to make that step was because ValueAct Capital, an activist investor, took board seats, understanding the need to support management in its longer-term thinking to allow the transition.

			The data is clear in companies, where the cost of not investing in the future is death, but what about some of our biggest institutions that we do not allow to fail? Specifically, the ones like education, healthcare, government. Wouldn’t those institutions suffer from the blind spots that allowed technology to change the game for leading companies? And if those institutions are larger, doesn’t it make sense that they would be more stuck in the status quo model of delivery, and therefore at greater risk? The difference is that our own governments and institutions define the rules by which we all play the game. If they are the most unlikely to see how those rules need to change or have the courage to take the bold leadership that is needed, we could all be frogs boiling in a pot, not realizing that the heat is being turned up until too late.

			But, really, it is not “them.” The same thing that allows our best and brightest companies to become irrelevant exists in every one of us. Whether it is sunk-cost bias, confirmation bias, or a host of other biases. Whether it is the overwhelming need to belong that drives us also to divide. Whether it is our short-term thinking with each of us at the centre of our own universe, or game theory that makes us cooperate or betray depending on the incentive or punishment. Whether it is the stories that we tell ourselves, so strongly reinforced in our minds that we miss the very thing biting at our nose.

			It is all of them—together. In each and every one of us.

			Why would our government institutions be exempt from the flaws of thinking common to all people? The same wiring of our biological computers (our brains) creates exceptionality in our species but also mistakes. That pattern recognition locks us into a path that makes us blind to signposts that don’t match our view of the world. Information growth and the rate of change will only accelerate from here, and in a world that is changing so fast, it is not reasonable to expect those in government to be any less vulnerable than we are—even if they set the rules.

			It is not that there isn’t conversation. All over the world, measures are being explored to try to deal with the problem of rising inequality. But the solutions proposed so far only serve to drive further division, because they fail to recognize the primary reason for that rise in inequality. Economic dogma gives us a false choice from frameworks built for a time before technology, when the world operated differently. Not seeing any other option, we lock into one economic framework or another and defend our position at all costs. And as positions becomes entrenched, we become blind to potential solutions that could save us, just like Kodak missing the digital camera.





Two ways forward


			Remember that, according to Ray Dalio, there are only four levers governments can pull to escape debt crises. The current debt burden is so large that any long-term solution must deal with it, so we will categorize the proposed solutions by how they attempt to use one of the four ways to escape the debt burden:

			Austerity—spending less

			Debt defaults/restructuring

			The central bank printing money or other guarantees

			Transfers of money from those who have more than they need to those who have less (much higher taxes for the rich)



			There has been very little mention of the first two levers. As we covered in chapter 1, because of deflation, austerity would create a vicious feedback cycle and a collapse in asset prices, combined with lower employment that would result in debt defaults or restructuring. Because of that, austerity (lever 1) and debt defaults and restructuring (lever 2) are inextricably linked. Whether we start with restructuring or austerity is immaterial; debt will need to be restructured. It is also the most painful for society to bear in the short term, so that might be why there is virtually no dialogue on either of these solutions.

			Paradoxically, the debt in the world is already so high that it’s not just austerity that would set off an unwind of asset prices and vicious feedback cycle. Slowing growth alone could set off this chain reaction, since the debt becomes unserviceable without fast-enough growth.

			Perhaps that is why almost all current proposals today land in two overarching camps on opposing sides of the political spectrum: on one side, those that use lever 3, and on the other side, those that use lever 4. The solutions in them are largely similar in their outcomes but have many different forms. Let’s look at the two sides one at a time.





Continued low or negative interest rate environment, central bank printing, modern monetary theory, or other guarantees to keep the party going


			The greatest irony of this camp is that it has the highest belief in a free-market economy and capitalism but at the same time doesn’t realize that free-market capitalism is not what is happening today.

			Many of the current policies around the world could be categorized here, along with many other proposals on the table. When you hear about central bank easing or stimulus, think of this camp. Negative interest rates, modern monetary policy, printing money and driving it into hands of spenders, national and local tax cuts to increase spending—it doesn’t matter what you name it or what form it takes, all of these solutions keep the party going by driving more debt. It really doesn’t matter if that debt is government, corporate, or personal. It all juices the economy or parts of the economy in the short term while pushing more pain in the longer term.

			In the short term, this approach can be successful because people feel richer—that is, until the bill is due. As we see in businesses that fail to transition to a new economic reality, it takes bold leadership to do what is needed for the long term, because the short-term pain is too great. But as a by-product of not taking bold action for the long term, the business is forced into bankruptcy later. I call this the kick-the-can-down-the-road strategy—or rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Another way of looking at this strategy is “growth at any cost to society.”

			A day will come, probably sooner than later, when we realize that the only thing driving our economies is the explosion of debt. If governments need to run huge deficits with extremely low interest rates for fear of growth failing, even in economies that are running at near full employment, imagine how the debt and deficits explode in a recession or depression when the economy falters. Once bond holders determine that governments have little ability to repay or service the debt, the risk premium (or interest rates) on the debt will rise. Sure, governments can monetize and make their currencies worthless, but as other central banks monetize as well, the strategy itself becomes irrelevant.

			As we have seen throughout this book, this strategy has only one endgame: 1) higher inequality, 2) people losing hope in the system due to not being able to make ends meet, 3) more polarization, 4) a rise of leaders that use the polarization to create “us versus them” narratives to consolidate power, and 5) commonplace revolution and wars. This solution, in the end, is a dissolution.





Higher taxes on the wealthy, guaranteed basic income


			This line of thinking in politics is the liberal/socialist/communist camp. It goes by the principle that the system should be fair for the disadvantaged, so we must tax the wealthy more to pay for the services to the poor.

			All of the solutions in this bucket require wealth transfers and, because of that, they are deeply unpopular to many of those with wealth. It is hard to see the money that you believe that you have earned because of your ingenuity or hard work go to others who you deem not to have worked as hard. The argument from those who have wealth is that the higher the tax rate on the wealthy, the more disincentive there is to take risks, innovate, and be a strong contributor to society.

			One of the more prominent proposals in this camp is universal basic income. In policy circles around the world, it is getting serious airtime. The idea is simple in premise: raise taxes on the wealthy to give a minimum basic income whether people work or not, topping people up if they work to a maximum amount but also not requiring them to work for their wage.

			The idea is hardly new; various proposals date back hundreds of years. In theory, it sounds reasonable. Even for the most ardent capitalist, it could be self-serving. Capitalism collapses in a world where there are no buyers. Job losses and income inequality will reduce the number of people who can participate in the economy. At some point along that continuum of fewer people participating in the economy, the math doesn’t work, and the system collapses anyway. That means that even though universal basic income sounds radical to some, it is at least an alternative to that outcome.

			On execution, it becomes much more difficult. Universal basic income is essentially a version of wealth transfer. Beyond the traditional arguments from the right that it disincentivizes work and, as a result, incentivizes people to get paid for nothing, there is a cornucopia of additional challenges because of the complexity in determining the right wage. How would government differentiate wages by needs—choosing to live in one city versus another, for example, because of varying costs of living? What if someone chose to live in an expensive city because the opportunities for jobs were higher there but still couldn’t find a job—would the basic income be higher for that person? What about people with disabilities or dependents?

			Determining the right amount of basic income differentiated for needs becomes difficult to reasonably achieve—especially since the higher the subsidy, the higher the tax on the wealthy, in turn creating a powder keg of division with each side believing they are being taken advantage of.

			The most important problem with the solution, though, is simply this: it does not deal with the root cause. Deflation is being caused by technology and, because of that, it will ride the same exponential wave that technology does. That means that the rate of deflation (without printing more money) will only accelerate from here. The abundance that technology provides us doesn’t require net new jobs around the world. It obliterates the work and the jobs we already have. That negative effect on jobs will accelerate globally. By cementing in a dual class society, we only ignore the underlying structural change that caused it in the first place. Ignoring that underlying reason is likely to create even more division.





Who’s controlling the money?


			Both of the above solutions don’t consider that since global debt is already so high and expanding quickly, a reset of debt is needed in any truly viable solution. That reset will likely be painful and could erase vast fortunes overnight while also creating new ones. Similar resets have happened in the past. There will be winners and losers depending on where bets are placed.

			In addition to this, both of the above solutions rely on a central function of government in setting monetary policy and controlling the underlying value of money, giving it power to drive stimulus to an economy when it needs it. But controlling the value of money can lead to abuse of power—especially if the currency is underlying other currencies.

			Just as game theory predicts, we care about our own needs first. Domestic issues always take precedent over international ones, which means a system that is controlled by one nation and is the backbone of all other currencies might work for a time—until the country’s domestic issues force it to unilaterally deliver economic benefit to the nation in control of the currency while hurting all others. Once trust is broken in that exchange, game theory predicts actions by other countries will encourage the growth of their own currencies—and all hell breaks loose because international cooperation is lost.

			In fact, as we have discussed, many of the same actions with each country devaluing their own currency in an attempt to win the trade game in the early 1900s sowed the seeds of discontent that led to World War II. Vowing not to repeat those mistakes that led to mass unemployment, authoritarianism, and World War II, leaders of the world came together in 1944 to establish Bretton Woods—a framework for global cooperation. A key construct of Bretton Woods was an agreed-upon international monetary system where all countries tied exchange rates to the price of gold and the US dollar; the US dollar became the primary currency of the world and the US dollar was tied to gold through a fixed exchange rate. The new rules established trust in an international framework that allowed global trade to expand and increased global prosperity because it meant that countries could not artificially manipulate their currencies at will.

			Again, as game theory predicts, the agreement showed that when countries work together with a clear understanding of the rules, prosperity was enhanced for all. But in 1971, the United States unilaterally terminated a critical aspect of the system—the conversion of the US dollar to gold—and with that change created a system where the US dollar, a fiat currency subject to domestic agenda, was the backbone of the world’s economic order. From here, Bretton Woods effectively ended. Since the US dollar became the primary currency of the world without a peg to gold, it gave the US tremendous influence in global affairs. It also enabled a single country to change the rules by printing more currency, and therefore set the stage to return to where we are now, where each country manipulates its currency for political gain while worsening a framework for fair trade.

			Bitcoin (and other cybercurrencies) is an attempt at a solution. The promise of Bitcoin was to create a system that was decentralized in nature, unable to be manipulated by anyone—including governments. As we have seen, money follows the rules of supply and demand; the US dollar goes up in value as demand for it increases relative to supply. Governments can change or manipulate this natural dynamic by increasing supply—printing more money, which lowers the value of their currency relative to others. Bitcoin attempts to change that dynamic by forever fixing supply at twenty-one million Bitcoins. In addition to that, it creates a peer-to-peer ledger without any central control: the blockchain. As an open, distributed ledger, it offers security and trust by verifying transactions with consensus instead of through a central authority.

			Although the blockchain that Bitcoin sits on has never been hacked, transactions are difficult, which has slowed widespread adoption as a payment alternative. In addition to that, storage of Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies (wallets) has been prone to cyberattack or loss, creating a different form of risk. But even with risk and current high volatility, citizens in some parts of the world have less risk in holding Bitcoin than their own currency. The value can be moved across borders seamlessly or used as a payment mechanism when currency fails. In Venezuela today, for example, Bitcoin is already acting as a lifesaving currency for those who have it, as it is a much more secure payment medium than the local currency.

			Bitcoin’s high volatility is often used as an example of why it cannot be trusted as a global payment mechanism. Bitcoin is volatile; it lost 30 percent of its value in 2018, only to rise over 100 percent in the first six months of 2019. But that volatility must be put in context. The inflation rate on the bolívar, Venezuela’s local currency, was 1.8 million percent in 2018. Having the choice, even in 2018, I would much rather lose 30 per-cent on my Bitcoin than 1.8 million percent on my bolívar.





The simple solution


			There is a principle in philosophy called Occam’s razor: a simpler solution is more likely to be correct than a complex one. It makes intuitive sense. Complexity makes us prone to error. As the number of assumptions in coming up with a hypothesis increases, the chances increase that one or more of those assumptions are wrong. To that end, I am going to propose what might be considered the simplest solution of all. So simple, in fact, that it will be hard to imagine.

			What if the natural order of things was permitted?

			What if, instead of trying to stop deflation at all costs, we embrace it? As technology spreads, deflation happens at the rate it should. Deflation becomes something celebrated because it means that we are getting more for less. We allow ourselves to accept abundance. Along that continuum, as technology removes jobs and fewer overall jobs are needed, prices will keep falling, allowing those who lose jobs a way to share in the benefit of technology abundance without massive transfers of wealth. If technology-driven price declines continue to the point of something becoming free, we let that happen, too. People will no longer have to be on an endless treadmill to pay for things that are constantly rising in price. As hard as that might be for us to accept, because it is such a radical change to the way things are today, it seems to me that it is the only real choice we have.

			It is hard to imagine this because we have grown up in a world where these choices did not exist. Where technology deflation was only in isolated pockets of our economies instead of throughout. Where we could count on training people into new jobs and industries not impacted by the changes and continue on the same path that drove prosperity in a different time. That same path is impossible to imagine going forward, with technology soon underpinning almost everything we do.

			It is easy to dismiss it out of hand, because we are trapped in a system where we don’t know what we would do with ourselves if we didn’t have jobs. Our careers are far more important to us than just the income that they bring. Our careers become part of the story of who we are—with our relationships and social status (our “us”) often coming from our jobs. For that reason, even if the facts are inescapable, that most of these jobs will be better done by technology, we bury our heads in the sand. The fear of a future without those jobs and self-worth that they bring stops us from imagining a better world in which they might not even be required.

			Consider this alternative: allowing abundance without the jobs might actually open an entirely new enlightenment era where we have time to enjoy the benefits that technology brings.

			A true capitalist system could work well in that environment because there would still be an incentive to work harder and innovate. Prices of all things would fall, yes, but those creating value would be paid for their value creation—at a rate that matched the new realities of supply and demand and our digital world. We still line up for the newest iPhone even while our service providers let us have older models for free, after all. But those who lose out in our societies would be less at risk. As an entire infrastructure needed to support more jobs to support price inflation resulting from monetary easing is removed, the cost of entitlement programs is removed with it. It becomes much cheaper to live, and thus the burden to those working drops.

			In the end, the trend is already clear and foretells a different way of living. It only matters how we get there. The deflationary aspect of technology is too great a force and it will eventually overwhelm even the greatest efforts to stop it. Those efforts to stop it, and the second-order consequences of that fight to halt deflation, will look insane to future generations because that fight will bring on revolutions and wars that burn the existing system to the ground. Allowing that to happen seems insanely irresponsible, since humanity might also forever lose the opportunity to have the kind of social uplift that is possible with technology.

			The solution I’m proposing, while simple in theory, has a number of potential limitations. For one thing, would governments around the world allow it to happen? Governments and central banks exert tremendous influence on their economies and citizens with their ability to control money supply. It is not likely that they would voluntarily give up that control to a new world currency that is unable to be manipulated. Without that manipulation of currencies, the natural trend of technology deflation would already be clear.

			Another such limitation is that a solution could not be rolled out in just one country. It would need to be rolled out in a coordinated effort internationally, since with trade, one country alone taking this action would be at a disadvantage to other countries still manipulating their currencies.

			While I am sure that governments will not voluntarily give up control of their currencies, if there is not a coordinated international effort on a Bretton Woods type of framework that establishes rules around currency exchange rates, it will happen regardless—just in a different way. Remember, a currency only holds value because of the deemed trust we have in it. Beyond that, it is just a piece of paper with faces and numbers on it. That trust is just an agreed upon exchange of value and that government will keep its promises. That trust is compromised if governments do not keep their promises—even if they pretend to by changing the value of the paper the promise is written on. The more that trust is eroded, the more likely that an alternative currency becomes a more trusted mechanism. That alternative—whether Bitcoin or something different—could emerge quickly.

			The digital and distributed nature of Bitcoin allows it to benefit from a network effect (which was discussed in chapter 2) with each additional user enhancing its value. As more users trust the system, more trust accretes to the system. Although it is hard to imagine it surpassing any of the main currencies, that reality could easily change tomorrow as more currencies come under pressure; the by-product of that pressure increases the value of Bitcoin or Bitcoin type of network. In other words, what starts as a way for citizens in Venezuela and other regions of the world to escape crushing currency devaluation could jump from country to country and easily build to a point where it becomes the de facto standard of trust.

			But what do I know? Even though I think I am aware of my own vulnerabilities in judgment and biases and do my best to correct for them, I am only human, subject to the same flaws and errors as all of us. My solution is only one idea in a sea of many. Perhaps no one solution could work in isolation, and perhaps no solution could be implemented all at once. Maybe solutions need to be brought together through a series of steps to transition our economic foundations to something that works for a future that will predominantly be driven by technology.

			That is why I am asking you.

			It is clear that something must be done. But because the issues are so complex and thorny in nature, it is easy to put our heads in the sand and hope others will solve them. Trust me, I know. I have myself been sitting on the sidelines, talking about the same thing for about ten years and watching as resentment and polarization in our societies grow. I wrote this book not because I had any desire to but because I grew tired of a lack of real debate about the core issues and solutions and am increasingly worried about world conflict if we don’t act. About the world we will pass to our children.
