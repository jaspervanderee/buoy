        <div class="faq-content">
          <h2>What is Buoy?</h2>
          <p>Buoy is your guide into the Bitcoin ecosystem. We compare Bitcoin-only services like wallets, exchanges, and tools so users can make informed choices.</p>

          <h2>Why should I use Buoy?</h2>
          <p>We provide side-by-side comparisons of Bitcoin services based on key metrics like fees, KYC requirements, platform type, custody model, and more. This helps you save time and make confident decisions.</p>

          <h2>Does Buoy cover services for beginners?</h2>
          <p>Absolutely. Buoy is designed with beginners in mind. Whether you're looking for your first wallet or considering advanced tools like multisig storage, we provide clear information for all levels.</p>

          <h2>Is Buoy affiliated with any service providers?</h2>
          <p>No. Buoy is an independent, unbiased platform. Our focus is on delivering transparent information to empower Bitcoin users.</p>

          <h2>How does Buoy ensure objectivity and transparency in comparisons?</h2>
          <p>We use clear, publicly verifiable criteria for all comparisons, focusing on Bitcoin-aligned factors like decentralization, privacy, and open-source status. As an independent platform, we avoid conflicts of interest and encourage community input to maintain trust and accuracy.</p>

          <h2>Do you cover non-Bitcoin services or altcoins?</h2>
          <p>No. Buoy is dedicated exclusively to Bitcoin and its ecosystem. We believe in staying focused on what makes Bitcoin unique.</p>

          <h2>Are the services you list safe to use?</h2>
          <p>We provide key details like custody models, KYC requirements, and user reviews to help you assess each service. Ultimately, users should do their own due diligence before using any service. Don't trust, verify.</p>

          <h2>How often do you update the service information?</h2>
          <p>We aim to keep our information up-to-date with the latest offerings, updates, and feedback from the Bitcoin community. If you spot outdated information, please let us know!</p>

          <h2>Can I suggest a service for inclusion on Buoy?</h2>
          <p>Yes! We welcome suggestions. Use the contact form to share a service you'd like us to review and include.</p>

          <h2>How does Buoy make money?</h2>
          <p>Currently, Buoy is a free tool for the community. We may explore sustainable revenue options, but we will always prioritize neutrality and transparency.</p>

          <h2>Why is Buoy Bitcoin-only?</h2>
          <p>Bitcoin is money. It's a neutral, decentralized monetary network with a fixed supply (21 million) and no company or CEO that can change the rules.</p>
          <p>"Crypto" is a catch-all for thousands of venture-like tokens run by teams with variable rules, changing supplies, and higher counterparty risk.</p>
          <p>If you want long-term savings and true self-custody, choose bitcoin-only services. If you want to speculate on startup-style projects, that's crypto â€” a different game.</p>
